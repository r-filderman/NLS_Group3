9 Vaccination Preparedness Planning
 

Program and the Office for Public Health Preparedness and R
esponse (OPHPR).  Certainly, the 2009 H1N1 
vaccination campaign after action report pointed a few gaps in preparedness which have been 
systematic
ally addressed by both parties. 
Areas such as emergency management training, vaccine 
safeguard and coordinatio
n of mass vaccination events between jurisdictions have been at the top of the 
list.  
 
Improvement Planning
 
In 2010, PRDoH developed the first
-
ever Pandemic Influenza Operations Plan, detailing the methods and 
procedures to follow during pandemic emergency
 
operations, as well as the organization and define 

Immunization Program, the 
Office for Public Health Preparedness and Response (OPHPR)
 
and Puerto Rico 
De
partment of Health Senior Leadership.  
The trainings and exercises usually take place at the beginning 
of each influenza season.  These are essential to ensure emergency procedures are in place and the roles 
and responsibilities are well understood.  An af
ter
-
action review is completed for every exercise indicating 
lessons learned.  
Additionally, PRDoH executes a media and educational campaign every year to promote 
seasonal influenza vaccination. During the last couple of years, the PR Immunization Program 
has mainly 
focused on the following preparedness domains: 
 

 
Resiliency
 
-
 
Strengthened utilities and communications systems at all 8 regional offices and central office 
with energy and water back
-
up systems, radio and satellite communications network 
 

 
Incident
 
Management 
 
-
 
Trained 80% of the PR Immunization Program personnel in FEMA ICS 100, 200, 700 and 800, 
and at least 5 members completed the ICS 300 and 400. 
 
-
 

plans to m
aintain the cold chain.
 
-
 
Completed a major revision to its Emergency Operations Plan 
 
-
 
Conducts at least one program
-
wide exercise per year 
 
-
 
Activated in support of hurricanes and most recent earthquakes mass vaccinations
 
-
 
Plan at least 1 mass vaccination eve

with mobile coolers
 
In summary, both, PRDoH and vaccine providers have increased their capability to a surge in vaccines, 
cold medications and other biologics during emergencies or disaster.  In addition, this reduces loss of 
vaccines, cold medications, a
nd biologics during emergencies, therefore better positioning the recovery

19 Vaccination Program Planning
 
Prior to the development of this plan, PRDoH Senior Leadership undertook several actions to make 
infor
med decisions and commitment to maintain stakeholders informed on the progress prior to the 
arrival of COVID
-
19 vaccines.  The 
Under
-
Secretary of Health has taken on the initiative to reach 100% of 
stakeholders and has conducted several seminars directed t
o state agencies key officials and health 
organizations.  At the same time, the PR Immunization Program Director is currently tasked to establish 
the organization and operational procedures for a rapid and organized response of the components of 
the vaccin
ation system. 
 
 
Upon approval of this plan, PR health officials will apply lessons learned from previous incidents and 
exercises and develop

19 Vaccination Program Implementation Committee (Internal and External)
 
Under the leadership of the Under Secre
tary of Health, and if warranted, 
a broader committee of key 
internal leaders and external partners will be assembled to assist with implementing the vaccination 
program, reaching out to critical populations, and developing crisis and risk communication me
ssaging. 
The 
Under Secretary of Health
 
has established direct communications and collaboration with these 
internal/external entities and community partners.  Many 
of 
these partners have received detailed 
information about planning assumptions, vaccine recipie
nt priority groups, logistics and expected vaccine 
supply availability and provided expected outcomes. 
 
 
The Vaccination Program Implementation Committee is composed but not limited to the following 
organizations:

Municipality Coordination 
 
PR
 
governance structure is decentralized, composed of the state government and 78 independent 
municipalities, PRDoH has 7 Regions whereas PR Emergency Management Bureau has 11 Zones.  All the 
aforementioned have 
an Emergency Operations Center and interagency
 
emergency coordinators, 
ensuring best way of communication and coordination. 
 
It is expected that State and local authorities 
combine and coordinate response efforts and share information and resources. 
 
Incident Command Structure 
 
 
PRDoH is the lead Agen
cy for ESF # 8. The Office for Public Health Preparedness and Response (OPHPR) 
oversees coordinating the response of the public health and medical care system to an emergency or 
disaster caused by a pandemic. To this end, tasks will be previously assigned 

units, offices, programs, divisions, and departments as well as the Healthcare Coalitions and the ESF # 8 
support agencies.
 
The command structure will be activated at the state level 
by the Governor of Puerto Rico, the Secretary
 
of Health, or an authorized representative.  Currently, PRDoH is activated in and coordinating island
-
wide 
COVID
-
19 contact tracing and clinical response. 
 
PRDoH will augment its ICS structure either full or partial for COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program 
implem
entation, all response efforts
 
will be directed from PRDoH Department Operation Center (DOC)
.  
Stakeholders, federal and state agencies and municipalities are expected to have an activated ICS.  The
 
PR 
Immunization Program manages the CDC Immunization and 
Vaccines for
 
Children Cooperative Agreement 
on behalf of PRDoH, as such will assume the Operational Lead department wide under PRDOH Incident 
Command Structure 
(see diagram 1 below)
. 
 
Due to the complexity of the COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program Implementation
, most likely, an Area 
Command will be established to manage it. The Area Command will oversee the ICS structures established 
at PRDoH Regions.  A Unified Command will be the
 
structure located at PRDoH Regions (see diagram 2).
 
Internally, the PR Immunizati
ons Program will activate its Incident Command Center in support of COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program Implementation. The Immunization Program Incident Management Team will be 
a combination of current employees (operational level) and the hiring of 8
-
12 dedicat
ed personnel 
(tactical level) with specific roles and responsibilities. Strategic oversight (command) will be rotated with 
Program staff with previous experience in incident management such as Program Director, the CDC PHA, 
Program Coordinator, Vaccine Man
ager, VFC Coordinator and IQIP Coordinator (see diagram 3).

Section 3: Phased
 
Approach to COVID
-
19 Vaccination
 
It is expected changes or shortages 
will occur
 
in vaccine supply levels at any given time during the COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program
.  PRDoH and the Planning Team understands the implications and consequences 
and will adapt p
lanning efforts to be as flexible as possible considering a variety of likely scenarios.  
 
All COVID
-
19 MO
U
s
, signed with dispensing sites such as health service facilities, POD
s
, pharmacies, 
industries and elsewhere, have a
 
procedure 
that identifies the per
son or persons authorized to receive, 
sign and dispense vaccines and medicines. The credentials of the designated persons were also required 
at the time of signing the MOU. 
 
The plan will explain in detail the proper procedure for keeping the cold 
chain and
 
keeping vaccines 
to be administered
 
in optimal condition
.
 
Deciding who 
the priority groups are
 
will be made following the recommendations 
provided 
by 

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
including specific target populations an
d priorities 
for circumstances of limited or phased vaccine supply.  
 
 
Planning assumptions:
 

 
vaccine supply will be limited at the beginning of the program
 

 
vaccine supply is projected to increase quickly over the proceeding months
 

 
recommendations on the va
rious population groups to receive initial doses of vaccine could change 
after vaccine is available
 

 
vaccine supply and disease epidemiology may be affected by local community and other 
emergencies (i.e. hurricane season) 
 
Phase 1: Potentially Limited Doses
 
Available
 
In the initial phase (Phase 1) of the COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program, initial doses of vaccine will likely be 
distributed in a limited manner, with the goal of maximizing vaccine acceptance and public health 
protection while minimizing waste and i
nefficiency.  PRDoH will plan for high
-
demand and low
-
demand 
scenarios.
 
PRDoH Phase 1 i
nitial intervention planning and strategies 
targeted to each priority group (Phase 1A and 
1B) include a combination of, on site immunization for hospital personnel (also
 
is the preferred method 
for other organizations), and vaccination via private sector vaccinators, mobile vaccination providers and 
public health sponsored clinics. Agreements (MOU/MOA) will be enabled to 
allow maximum throughput 
of vaccinated individuals 
while maintaining social distancing and other infection control procedures. 
 
The initial phase concept of operations incorporates the following activities as a general guideline, each 
mode of intervention presented is not exclusive to a particular Phase an
d overlapping of settings and 
Phases will occur. 
 
Additional strategies may be incorporated to satisfy offer/demand requirements:

Large hospitals and health systems (Phase 1A, possible Phase 1B and Phase 2)
 

 
The pr

(see Appendix 1) 
and healthcare systems 
in 
P
R
 
known as 
CDT
s 
(
ses 
A

)
 
will be able to vaccinate their personnel on site through the infection control or 
employee vaccination clinic. Each Hospital will sign an agreement to be a COVI
D
-
19 vaccinator for 
their staff 
 

 
It is expected that 50% of hospitals
 
will provide immunization services to the public
 
This is the priority group to receive vaccines when limited availability. The Immunization Program Incident 
Commander and the hospitals infection control officers will coordinate with hospitals the dispatch
 
of the 
vaccines necessary for them to vaccinate their staff who will provide direct service to patients.  Once 
hospital workers have received the vaccine, the Immunization Program Incident Commander shall 
establish written and telephone communication with
 
next phase group such as first responders, hospitals 
and other health professionals that give direct care to patients and public health personnel agencies that 
will be involved in the distribution and administration of the vaccine and the persons responsi
ble for their 
safety (interim first priority group) during this phase.  
 
Private Sector (Phase 1B)
 

 
Government and business partners will be able to vaccinate their personnel on site through 
their occupational health clinics
 

 
Walgreens is pending the CDC Nat
ional Pharmacy Partnership Contract and may serve LTCF; if 
contract is not awarded, they will still provide similar support to the state
 

 
Community p
harmacies that 
serve as immunization providers
,
 
are 
willing 
to participate 
and 
able 
to 
vaccinate their personnel
,

Immunization Coalition VOCES
, 
National Guard 
and other private and 
NGO
s 
are 
available 
to 
engage 
and 
possibly
 
be tasked to LTCF and selected first re
sponders and critical workforce
 
Mobile v
accination providers (Phase 1B, Phase 2)
 

 
Selected organizations in Puerto Rico already communicated interest in participating as 
vaccination providers to reach critical population and underserved areas, they will be enrolled as 
providers for COVID
-
19 vacci
ne after complete assessment of their capabilities to receive
, 
store 
and
 
administer vaccine maintaining adequate cold chain.
 
 
As an example, the State Agency for Emergency Management is dividing in eleven (11) zones; each zone 
has an Emergency Operations Center. 
 
Several strategies to consider are (1 or more as applicable or a 
combination)
; 
activate the PR National Guard, contract 
private
 
provider(s) or an NGO with mobile 
capability reach out to each zone and vaccinate all the first responders that are
 
convened 
in that zone.
 
These priority groups should present themselves at the designated vaccination POD with their 
professional ID to be used to identify them. The credentials of volunteers, PR DOH staff and first 
responders will be verified. It will also be check
 
what kind of work they do regularly or day by day.

providers that are in 8 health regions.  Those VFC providers will be required to vaccinate patients in 
targeted groups daily for a defined period.  We have initiate
d
 
agreements with commu
nity vaccinators to 
conduct clinic and 
complete 
an 
enrollment 
agreement between providers and public health
 
authority
 
(COVID
-
19 Vaccine Provider Agreement).
 
 
In addition, collaborative agreements will be established with other agencies and municipalities to share 
medica
l personnel resources, especially nursing staff with capability to administer vaccine to their own 
personnel.  Examples of this may include the Department of Education and the Department of Correction.  
 
 
The Immuni
zation Program Health Educator in coordin
ation with the Risk Communications Coordinator 
at the Office of Preparation and Coordination of Response in Public Health, will be in charge of developing 
educational 
materials
 
on the importance of vaccination, to be distributed among the priority groups.  Th
ey 
will also design presentations that can be offered by Health Professionals, Health Educators in agencies 
or organizations representing priority groups. 
 
Phase 2: Large Number of Doses Available, Supply Likely to Meet Demand
 
During this Phase, PRDoH will
 
reassess the activities established in Phase 1 and either continuity or 
modification is granted for Phase 2: on site immunization for hospital personnel (also is the preferred 
method for other organizations), and vaccination via private sector vaccinators
, mobile vaccination 
providers and public health sponsored clinics.  The start of Phase 2 also makes the planning team to start 
planning performing current operations assessments (
populations who were not yet vaccinated)
 
and 
future operations planning (new
 
subgroups to be vaccinated) concurrent.  Once again, additional 
strategies may be incorporated to meet operational requirements.   The number of open PODs that could 
be activated during the emergency will depend on the target region and population as the 
availability of 
an adequate location.
 
PRDoH is responsible for providing mass vaccination against any threat that may cause a public health 
emergency (PHE). This responsibility is shared through collaboration and coordination with local agencies, 
such as m
unicipal governments and community organizations. 
 
If there is a surge in health professionals, additional volunteers will be recruited and trained through the 
Puerto Rico Health Volunteer Corps (MRC
-
PR), municipal governments and community organizations, 
such as the International Rotary Club and the American Red Cross. The Plan also includes a Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOU) with all municipalities in Puerto Rico in which each municipality is asked to 
provide a minimum of volunteers. Some of these volunt
eers are nurses, paramedics, and other health 
professionals. MRC
-
PR is the primary recruiter for volunteers to work on a PHE.  We may also expect to 
have nurses, doctors and administrative staff from other programs of the Department of Health and other 
gove
rnment agencies (National Guard, Volunteer Corps of the Department of Health of Puerto Rico, Head 
Start, Department of Education, WIC Program, Mothers and Children Program, among others).

In PR, the only health professionals authorized to administer vacci
nes to persons 21 and older are 
physicians (MD), registered nurses (RNs) and pharmacists provided they have their qualifications and are 
up to date with their licenses. Only doctors (MD) and registered nurses are approved to vaccinate people 
under the age 
of 12.  PR will allow pharmacists to vaccinate children older than 3 years old under the 
federal preemption in the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for Medical 
Countermeasures Against COVID

Phase 3: Likely Sufficient Supply, Slowing D
emand
 
PRDoH will remain focused on ensuring equitable vaccination access across the entire population with 
constant monitoring of vaccine uptake and coverage; reassessing strategies to increase uptake in 
populations or communities with low coverage.
 
Planni
ng Assumptions for Phase 3:
 

-
19 vaccine supply where supply might exceed demand 
 

 
 
Phase 3 
planning strategies will need to focus on the demobilization and downsizing of 
the PRDoH and PR 
Immunization Program Incident Command and transition 
into routine vaccination programs, run by both 
public and private partners.  
According to Organic Law 81, the Secretary of Health may establish the rules 
and priorities for the distribut
ion and use of vaccines in PR.  
 
This is also the time for the ICS to start compiling information for the After
-
Action Report. 
 
 
As a transition to regular vaccination is expected to occur, before a clinic can be implemented, standing 
orders will be obtain
ed from the public health authority, usually a state health officer to provide 
authorization for administration of the COVID
-
19 vaccine.  Standing orders are also needed for responding 
to medical emergencies that occur during vaccination clinics, ranging f
rom minor injuries and illness to 
anaphylactic shock.  
 
 
The PR Immunization Program upon ICS deactivation, will plan the following strategies: 
 
 
a.
 
Continue to focus on equitable vaccination access to vaccination services 
 
b.
 
Monitor COVID
-
19 vaccine uptake and
 
coverage in critical populations and enhancing   strategies to 
reach populations with low vaccination uptake or coverage 
 
c.
 
Increase the number of VFC providers by partnering with commercial and private entities to ensure

Section 4: Critical Populations
 
Identifying and Estimating Critical Populations
 
PRDoH Senior leadership first
 
planning priority is to identify and estimate the critical populations within 
the jurisdiction, as well as identify the organizations that can provide the information.  The Under 
Secretary of Health tasked 

-
19 Vaccination Planning Te
am to estimate critical 
populations. The task has been distributed throughout specific PRDoH departments, programs and 
divisions that provide direct service to the target populations. In addition, 
the 
Under Secretary of Health 
initiated a few webinars with ext
ernal state and local agencies that provide services to these populations 
and started planning with potential agencies and organizations that will provide vaccination services.  
 
The 
purpose of this tool is for PRDoH to have a good understanding prior to v
accine arrival of COVID
-
19 of 
population demographics.  Recent estimates of adult population target in Phase 1 and 2 combined may 
exceed 1.5 million residents, this data needs to be confirmed. 
  
 
 
 
It is expected 
the information will be completed wit
hin 30
-
45 days 
(refer to Table 3 for a macro level 
sample on 
Who
 
the information will be collected from, for illustration purposes only
).  Detailed 
demographics will be developed for each priority group.  It is especially important to mention, that the 
org
anization providing the information, may not necessarily administer the vaccines.  The initial essential 
information to be gathered are is:  
 
-
 
Who: who is/are the organizations and type, & POC   
 
-
 
What: what population the organization serve
 
-
 
Where: where is/
are the locations service will be provided, where the population resides
 
-
 
When: when the organization be ready to provide the service
 
-
 
Why: why the organization wants to participate 
 
-
 
How many: how many people the organization serve
 
There are many advantages 
in Identifying and estimating critical populations.  Once the information is 
compiled, it will be very useful for the 
COVID
-
19 Vaccination Planning Team and/or 
PR Immunization ICS 
structure to 
plan interventions, build allocation strategies/COAs and delive
ring reports throughout the 
vaccine management planning, deployment and execution phases.

The Puerto Rico Department of Health will also use the first responder database as the estimate to make 
our planning projections.  The first responders in Puerto Rico already receive ev
ery year the seasonal 
influenza vaccine.  The strategy that is going to be used for COVID
-
19 vaccination purposefully is 
remarkably similar to the process they already know and use seasonal flu vaccination.

Under Secretary of Health is 
currently conducting planning webinars with external state and local agencies that provide services to 
these populations.  
The Immunization Program director, together with th
e Regional Immunization 
Coordinators, also established communications with the registered vaccine providers and potential 
providers island wide.  
 
 
Furthermore, through the Influenza Pandemic Plan of PR a directory list was compiled with the contact 
person i
nformation from all agencies and organization involved in the response.    
 
PR Immunization Program will employ the HHS Tiberius Analytic Support software to track critical 
population locations. We expect to utilize the SME provided by HHS and embedded in

Vaccination Provider Recruitment
 
During the initial phase, the PR Immunization Program delegated the VFC Coordinator (early October) 
with the task to disseminate COVID
-
19 Vaccination Pr
ovider Recruitment and Enrollment form throughout 
the 8 regions via the Regional Coordinators.  The purpose is to enroll and onboard Phase 1 providers as 
quickly as possible with a target date of October 31, 2020.   The Regional Coordinators will be contac
ting 
directly the providers and will follow
-
up the enrollment process and serve as the primary contact 
the 
hospitals in their area of coverage. 
 
The VFC Coordinator will receive signed agreements on a weekly basis. 
 
Once the ICS structure is in place, PR
 
I
mmunization Program will hire a dedicated enrollment coordinator 
reporting to the Planning Section Chief. 
  
At this time, Phase 1 provider onboarding process will be manual 
by sending the agreement by email to selected Phase 1 providers.  Providers will be
 
reached directly by 
the corresponding Immunization Regional Office personnel to complete the process.  Once enrollment is 
received, it will be uploaded into IIS once account is created. 
Reports every two weeks.
 
For healthcare providers who are interested 
in or are encouraged to become vaccine providers, the 
Immunization Program will develop and implement a vaccine provider outreach and training plan, 
focusing first on the immunization providers that can serve remaining critical populations.
 
 
The PR DOH Imm
unization Program has identified a total of 66 hospitals and CDTs with emergency 
treatment capability to administer the 
first available COVID
-
19 vaccine doses specifically for Phase 1.  
Identification of providers for other groups (Phase 1B, 2 and 3), a pa
rtial list has been developed (see 
Table 3).  We will follow a systematic approach in identifying all possible organizations that provide 
services, and firstly initiate contact through associations, coalitions, colleges and others to reach a large 
number i
n the les possible time thus maximizing efficiency.     
The PR Immunization Program currently has 
a large group of public (VFC/VFA) and private vaccine (204 VFC; 300+ private). 
 
 
Puerto Rico 
has over 
70 community pharmacies that are authorized and certif
ied to be able to 
administer vaccines by their pharmacists inside and outside these facilities (Extramural License).
 
 
T
he Community Pharmacy Association and its president, the COVID

be sent to these pharmacies to be compl
eted and returned to the Immunization Program 
offices.
  
These agreements will be entered into the IIS and VTrck System in order to request and

Phase 1 providers.  Providers will be reached directly by the corresponding Immunization Regional Office 
personnel to start the enrollment process.  
 
During the COVID
-

access to the Puerto Rico Electronic Immunization System (PREIS).  The PR Immunization Pr
ogram Incident 
Command will have at least 2 dedicated staff to provide training and resolve all issues related to IIS.
 
 
Enrollment Exceptions (Waivers)
 
PRDoH may waive specific vaccine provider enrollment requirements in coordination with Office of 
Regulat
ion and Licensing of Medical Professionals (SARAF in Spanish).  For example, providers who 
vaccinated previously, and are not current doing so, but have appropriate vaccine storage equipment 
(refrigerator, freezer and thermometers), with licenses not updat
ed may receive a waiver.  Another 
strategy PRDoH Secretary may consider and can be implemented to increase the number of providers and 
access, if a provider complies with CDC VFC vaccine contract requirements, may receive a state temporary 
waiver be grante
d during the pandemic emergency 
solely to
 
administer COVID
-
19 vaccines.
 
 
Provider Enrollment Data
 
The PR Immunization Program will hire a dedicated enrolment coordinator and will submit 
provider 
enrollment data per 
CDC requirements.  
On a weekly basis, he/
she will be sending to the central office all 
the signed vaccine agreements, to be entered in the IIS System (IZDL). This process will be in effect for the 
entire month of October, until it covers all the island's hospital institutions (Phase 1). 
 
Once the

demonstrate that they have the facilities, permits and equipment to repackage and redistribute the 
vaccines to other institutions or places for the administra
tion of the COVID
-
19 vaccine.  These providers 
may redistribute to: 
 

 
Vaccination clinics that provide home vaccination services or satellite clinics with a smaller 
audience.  They must present the permits for extramural vaccines.
 

 
Community Pharmacies that 
vaccinate outside their facilities, at special events, or at home.  They 
must present the extramural vaccination certificate.
 
 
These providers must fill out an additional agreement, which is related to the redistribution of the COVID
-
19 vaccine, to a place
 
other than the one where the vaccine was originally received. This is the COVID
-
19 
Vaccine Redistribution Agreement.

-
 
Expedite provider waiver approval in communities with little or no providers
 
-
 
Create agreements
 
with commercial or private partners to vaccinate specific groups
 
-
 
Increase mode of vaccine administration in specific regions (i.e. mobile clinics, drive thru 
vents)
 
There will be multiple types of sites with a variety of providers enrolled all throughout 
the island, once 
the vaccine become available, to ensure accessibility.  Examples of the different types are hospitals, clinics, 
VFC/VFA providers, Open PODS, mobile units directed at elderly housing, closed POD (Correction 
Facilities), etc.
 
Commercial and
 
Federal Partners
 
 
There is a large number of federal agencies from the executive and judicial branches located in Puerto 
Rico covering the majority of service sectors.  PRDoH will engage with federal partners to understand 
their capability to vaccinate th
eir employees.
 
 
Commercial partners may also receive allocations directly from CDC once larger volumes of vaccine are 

expect to partner with commercial entities
 

national contract.  These large drugstore chain, for example, may be particularly helpful in conducting 
PODs as well as vaccinating LTCF residents and staff.
 
 
The Under Secretary of Health or design
ee, will establish 
direct communications and collaboration with 
federal entities prior to vaccine arrival.  Detailed information about planning assumptions, vaccine 
recipient priority groups, logistics and expected vaccine supply availability and provided 
expected 
outcomes will be provided.  Upon vaccine arrival, all communications and coordination will be made from

19 Vaccine Administration Capacity
 
In any given year, PR register i
n the IIS between 600,000 and 800,000 administered doses combining 500 
plus public and private providers.  In general, vaccine providers already have a good estimation of their 
own capacity, since vaccine administration is big part of their regular service
.  They also have a good 
understanding of the size and type of the population in the area they provide services, which could also 
help them and us to have a good approximation of their vaccine needs.  PRDoH will also historical capacity 
lessons learned obs
erved during the Flu pandemic of 2009, hurricanes Irma and Maria and the 10 planned 
seasonal influenza mass vaccination events and incorporate in the planning process.
 
 
The Under Secretary of Health tasked

m to develop 
a v
accine administration capacity tool.  The purpose of this tool is for PRDoH to have a good understanding 
prior to vaccine arrival of COVID
-

 
 
 
Development of the tool is currently in proces
s expected to have a draft with 30
-

Section 7: COVID
-
19 Vaccine Allocation, Ordering, Distribution, and 
Inventory Management
 
It is uncertain when supplies of COVID
-
19 vaccine will be available. PRDoH
 
understands that early dose 
distribution will be limited; therefore, phased allocation of early vaccine doses will likely be necessary
.  
Once a COVID
-
19 vaccine has been approved, PRDoH will be tasked to quickly provide millions of doses to 
the population
 
and this poses an enormous logistical challenge.
 
Vaccine 
Allocation 
 
PRDoH will determine the amount of COVID
-
19 vaccine allocated to each target group.  
C
urrent 
allocation 
methodology for critical populations 
will focus on the following strategies:
 

 
Acqui
re 100% Phase 1 vaccine doses for healthcare workers (including ancillary staff, vaccinators, and 
staff in LTCFs), other essential workers, and people residents of LTCF.
 

 
Match specific target group with a specific vaccine brand to minimize second dose inte
rruptions
 

 
Phase 1 second dose vaccination activities may occur simultaneously with Phase 2 first dose
 
o
 
Phase 1 vaccination may not be 100% completed to initiate vaccination at other Phases granted 
changes in disease epidemiology and changes in population en
vironmental conditions 
 

 
Once supply stabilizes, will proceed targeting additional groups 
 
PR Immunization Program will employ the HHS Tiberius Analytic Support software and expect SME 
embedded to assist with micro planning activities, building allocation s
trategies/COAs and delivering 
reports throughout the vaccine management planning, deployment and execution phases.  
 
Vaccine Ordering 
 
PR Immunization Program will follow an expedited procedure similar to VFC vaccine ordering.  COVID
-
19 
vaccine ordering sh
ould be a seamless process as PR Immunization Program staff is very experienced in 
this process. 
PR Immunization staff will ensure COVID
-
19 providers orders vaccines from the same 
manufacturer for consistency.   
 
All vaccine orders placed in PR IIS will
 
be reviewed firstly by the corresponding PR Immunization Program 
Regional Office and confirmed by the Vaccine Manager or designee in an effort to reduce over
-
ordering 
and reduce the risk of vaccine being sent to an incorrect address.  Once the providers a
re enrolled and 
subscribed in the PR IIS they are going be able order vaccines and export information to 
VTrckS
 
for process 
completion by PR Immunization staff. 
 
 
To expedite the ordering process, providers should: 
 

 
accurately recorded in PR SIIS 
 

 

 

 
Place a new order 
when reaching at least 20% inventory

Provider allowable order
ing frequency will be evaluated (i.e. providers may place an order as frequently 
as every 30 days).  This requirement still to be to be determined and may be non
-
applicable like influenza 
vaccines.   Based on supply availability PR Immunization staff will 
approve order amounts as minimum or 
maximum based on provider profile.  
 
PR Immunization Program will employ the HHS Tiberius Analytic Support software and expect SME embed 
to assist with micro planning activities, building allocation strategies/COAs and d
elivering vaccine ordering 
reports for you throughout the planning, deployment and execution phases of our COVID

.  
PR I
mmunization Program 
staff may reduce orders to address over

on availability of vaccines. 
 
 
Distribution 
 
The Immunization Program ICS structure will appoint a dedicated Vaccine Manager (Logistics Section 
Chief) with specific responsibilit
ies to track vaccine distribution.  PR Immunization Program will follow a 
similar process to VFC for tracking shipments and returns. 
 
 
PR Immunization Program will employ the HHS Tiberius Analytic Support software to track vaccine 
distribution. We expect t
o utilize the SME provided by HHS and embedded in the ICS structure to support 
vaccine distribution tracking activities, daily/weekly/monthly reports delivery throughout the operation.  
All COVID

19 shipments will be tracked daily by the PR Immunization IC
S Logistics Chief, and information 
reported thru PRDoH EOC for situational awareness. 
 
 
Inventory Management 
 
PR Immunization Program will closely monitor COVID
-

administered and inventory must report in the PR II
S to indicate vaccines currently in stock. Providers 
should also perform a physical inventory count and ensure it matches the vaccines on hand in the PR IIS.   
Immunization Program staff will generate reports to estimate how many doses are necessary to sup
port 

evaluate provider prior vaccine dispatch and establish inventory adequate capacity levels. PR 
Immunization Program staff will evaluate orders by com
paring doses administered reports over a period 
of time, inventory on hand, and doses requested.

information 
available as of August 26, 2020. Updated information will be provided as it becomes available.  Vaccines 
must be stored properly from the time they are manufactured until they are administered.
 
 
PR Immunization staff will ensure selected COVID

compliance in order to obtain approval to administer vaccines.  
 
 
Roughly 75% of VFC providers and 50% of private vaccine providers in PR obtained 
within the last 24 
months
 
brand new 
vaccine storage units (fridges and freezers) meeting CDC recommendations
.  In 
addition, 60%
-
70% of hospitals also received donated equipment.  PRDoH do not foresee vaccine storage 
and handling to be a limitation in the planning and implementation process. 
 
 
Because PR is a tropical island with warm to hot temperatures all year
 
round the Immunization Program 
has already made a petition not to be assign the COVID
-
19 vaccine that has 
ultra
-
cold
 
chain requirements.    
Furthermore, all regular vaccine providers already have, by virtue of the VFC contract, the resources 
  
 
PUERTO RICO COVID
-
19 VACCINATION PLAN

Page
 
 
necessary to 
maintain the cold chain of the regular vaccines.  These providers must maintain temperature 
records of their refrigerated storage units and report any event where the temperature went over or 
under the vaccine temperature specification.
 
 
PR Immunization Pr
ogram will follow a similar process to VFC for any unplanned repositioning (i.e., 
transfer) of COVID
-
19 vaccine.   Each provider will be assigned to an Immunization Region and initial 
transfer approval are granted by the Immunization Regional Coordinators.
  
Typically, transfers will occur 
intra
-
region, therefore, cumulative inventories become a regional asset.  Other types of transfer require 
prior approval form the Regional Coordinator and the Vaccine Manager. All vaccine transfers will be 
tracked at the I
CS and recorded into the PR IIS and inventory updated in real time.  
 
 
In case that satellite, temporary, or off
-
site vaccinations settings represent a challenge to the proper 
management of the cold chain, the recently developed (through the 2018 Hurricane
 
Maria Crisis 
Cooperative Agreement Grant) a Regional Vaccine Storage Centers network will provide support and 
coordination.  
A present, there are 61 regional storage centers (see 
Appendix 1
)
, with MOU with PRDoH 
and received equipment loaners meeting CDC
 
recommendations.   Also, each of the 8 immunization 
regions has prepositioned at least 2 fridge freezes (5,000 doses capability) battery operated refrigerators 
that can withstand 4 days without electric power.  In addition, PR has at least 40 private vacc
ine providers 
that can be voluntarily activated to surge regional vaccine storage needs.  
 
 
The purpose of these storage centers is to safeguard vaccines and improve regional vaccine 
transportation.  They also assist in emergencies, such as problems with t
he electrical system, natural 
phenomena or need for space to store a larger amount of vaccines.  These centers are distributed 
throughout the immunization regions proportionally to the number of providers and population.   
 
 
PR Immunization Program may act
ivate specific(s) storage center to support satellite, temporary, or off
-
site vaccinations by fulfilling cold chain or other requirements whatever the case might be.
  
In case, the 
demand exceeds the regional storage centers vaccine handling capabilities, a
greements are underway 
with the PR National Guard to suffice mobile refrigerators.  
 
 
All COVID

Second Dose Reminder Methods
 
PRDoH primary method for second dose reminder recall and text message will be thru PR IIS.  
 
About 50% of vaccine providers (pharmacies an
d healthcare systems) in PR have their own systems for 
patient notifications and reminders, some using functionality within their electronic health record (EHR) 
systems.  Providers with EHR systems will be required data exchange to the PR IIS automatically
 
or delayed 
(i.e. HL7 file) daily, this will ensure second dose reminder redundancy. 
 
 
In addition, COVD

Vaccination providers will be highly encouraged to complete 
COVID

19 vaccination record cards with accurate vaccine informati
on (i.e., vaccine manufacturer, lot 
number, date of first dose administration, and second dose due date).  Providers can also request vaccine 
recipients to use their phone calendars before leaving the premises. 
 
 
When the person receives the first dose, th
ey will be informed of the need to receive a second dose 
between 21 to 28 days later.  The person will be also informed as to the available locations, other PODS, 
other providers, pharmacies, clinics, etc., where they can get hey can get this second dose. 
 
 
 
If the vaccines are administered by a provider on setting such as clinics, hospitals, pharmacies etc., these 
will be already enrolled in the IIS therefore will have 24 hours to register the vaccines administered and 
the IIS team at the Immunization Prog
ram will be monitoring this.  If the vaccine is administered in a closed 
POD, there will be two options for the data entry into the IIS system.  If there is space, equipment and 
staff (lap

unted on the PODs and the 
data will be entered as vaccines are administered (see Annex II).  If space, equipment, and staff are not 
available, a central data entry location shall be
 
established for the first and second doses of the COVID

and onboard Phase 1 providers.  At this time, Phase 1 provider onboarding process will be manual by 
sending the agreement by email to selected Phase 1 providers.  Providers will be 
reached directly by the 
corresponding Immunization Regional Office personnel to complete the process.  Once enrollment is 
received, it will be uploaded into IIS once account is created. Re
-
distribution providers will also be 
identified upon further intervi
ew.
 
Providers are expected to receive IIS account provision after November 1, 2020 when IIS is available, 
continuing with next steps per table below.  Once IIS is operational, we expect to transition to an 
electronic expedited onboarding process for Phases
 
2 and 3, and afterwards transitioned to routine 
vaccine program duties.

vaccine administration.  
 
PR Immunization IIS will be able to capture and report data to satisfy CDC and jurisdictional reporting 
requirements.  Prior experience indicates that a high number of vaccine providers enter the data directly 
into the IIS, we se
e no issues with 
providers reporting within 24 hours of administration. 
 
Onboarding to the IZ Gateway and required to sign the Data Use Agreement (DUA) with Association of 
Public Health Laboratories (APHL) to participate in both IZ Gateway Connect and IZ G
ateway Share will be 
performed by IIS vendor (STC) on behalf of PRDoH.  PRDoH will also execute the MOU to share data with 
other jurisdictions through the IZ Gateway.  PRDoH will ensure necessary policies are in place prior to data 
sharing with CDC and oth
er jurisdictions.
 
PR Immunization Program will employ the HHS Tiberius Analytic Support software and expect an SME 
embedded in the ICS structure to support IIS with IIS data management.    In addition, Immunization 
Program will hire a dedicated IIS Data Qu
ality Manager to monitor data quality and the steps to be taken 
to ensure data are available, complete, timely, valid, accurate, consistent, and unique.  IIS Data Quality 
Manger and the dedicated Medical Consultant will 
be tasked to update PRDoH Clinical D

main purpose is to educate and promote 
de vaccination as a prevention measure to avoid the virus and avoid additional outbreaks.
 
The main message of the communication plan is that vacc
ination is a safe prevention key against COVID
-
19; still reinforcing the messages that use of masks, washing hands and the physical distancing, are also 
required to keep the virus away. The communication team will develop a plan to massify the message in 
a
n effective way to reach the different audiences.   
 
Key Audiences 
 
The 
key audiences 
for the communication plan are: 
 

 
Healthcare providers
 

 
Media
 

 
Government agencies 
 

 
Non profit organizations
 

 
Puerto Rico Residents and Special Population 
 

 
Stakeholders and a
dditional partners
 
Broad Communication Planning Phases
 
Phase 1: The Immunization Program Health educator in coordination with the Area of Communications at 
Risk of the Office of Preparation and Coordination of Response in Public Health, will oversee the 
de
velopment of educational pieces on the importance of vaccination, to be distributed among the priority 
groups.  They will also design presentations that can be offered by Health Professionals, Health Educators 
in agencies or organizations representing prio
rity groups.
  
The
 
Immunization Program director shall 
establish written and telephone communication with first responders, health professionals and public 
health personnel agencies that will be involved in the distribution and administration of the vaccine
 
and 
the persons responsible for their safety (first priority group) during the alert phase.
 
During 
P
hase
s 
2 and 3 the Department of Health will provide information to health care providers, local 
and state government officials, and the media such regardin
g topics such as the rationale behind priorities 
and the list of priority groups, vaccination phases, when and where vaccines will be available and if 
interest in vaccination has declined, emphasize the importance of
 
vaccination due to the likelihood of 
su
bsequent waves of the pandemic.   Multiples modalities of mass communication will be used such as 
radio, press, TV and social media platforms.

Communication Activities
 
The plan includes the non
-
profit organizations as allies of the vaccination information 
dissemination 
program and the implementation of the vaccination media tour to reach all the population. The media 
will also be key for the communication plan, which will require trainings in the vaccination plan and the 
key words, in order to make them par
t of the process. 
 
As part of the strategies, will focus on:
 

 
Educate the general population through the press, radio, social networks, among other means, 
on COVID
-
19 symptoms, hand hygiene, vaccination and other prevention measures.
 

 
Keep media contacts upd
ated of the vaccination program 
 

 
Implement and maintain resources for the community and health professionals such as phone 
lines and internet pages where questions can be answered.
 

 
Prepare situational updates for the media in coordination with the CDC.
 

 
Pro
vide information to healthcare providers, municipal and state government officials and the 
media on:
 
o
 
priority groups and the reason.
 
o
 
vaccination phases after processing the priority groups.
 
o
 
where and when the vaccinations will take place. 
 

 
Emphasize the im
portance of vaccination given the possibility of additional outbreaks.
 

 
Make public announcements for all health professionals who may qualify to be vaccine 
administrators.  
 

 
Reinforce education for the general population with public education campaigns, th
rough the 
various means available, on pandemic influenza symptoms; hand hygiene; the respiratory tag; 
and other prevention measures.
 
Messaging Considerations
 
The plan will be held following the guidelines of the American with Disabilities Act, The Rehabili
tation Act, 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, The Plain Language Act and other applicable disability 
rights laws for accessibility. As part of the strategy we will monitor the effectiveness of the communication 
plan and update it based on res
ults.
 
One of the most important components for public health communications during the pandemic is the 
provision of information on the pandemic vaccine. It is necessary to work with federal partners to 
disseminate accurate, useful and consistent public hea
lth messages and to provide information according 
to local needs.

Communication Channels
 
The media channels that 
are proposed 
for the communication plan are: 
 
-
 
TV spots, 
 
-
 
TV media tour interviews with the
 
selected 
spokespersons
 
-
 
website information
 
-
 
social media posts
 
-
 
webinars, radio spots
 
-
 
radio media tour interviews
 
-
 
press releases and press ads in national and regional newspapers
 
-
 
digital media techniques postings. 
 
We will also work in the development of ed
ucational resources such as fact sheets, pamphlets and 
informative e
-
mails reports to keep health providers and general population updated of the vaccination 
calendar and reach. The plan considers the establishment of a call center to attend population gen
eral 
questions; that can be done in collaboration with municipalities and government agencies. We will also 
work in the education of health professionals on the importance of the vaccination program, as well as 
the vaccine administrators.
 
Partners and Trus
ted Sources  
 
The plan includes the non
-
profit organizations as allies of the vaccination information dissemination 
program and the implementation of the vaccination media tour to reach all the population. The media 
will also be key for the communication p
lan, which will require trainings in the vaccination plan and the 
key words, in order to make them part of the process. 
 
As part of the communication strategies, the preparation and training of spokepersons will be key to offer 
accurate information to the 
population. The selection of the spokepersons will consider their health 
knowledge, as well as the population recognition factor. In the other hand, community leaders, athletes, 
artists, journalists and 
TV
 
personalities will also be consider part of the co
mmunications campaign.
 
Crisis and Risk Communication
 
The Immunization Program 
Director, Program Coordinator, 
Health 
E
ducator
 
or designee 
in coordination 
with the Area of Communications at Risk of the Office of Preparation and Coordinati
on of Response in 
Pu
blic Health will develop crisis and risk communication plan.  
 
Communication and educational materials on the registration of COVID
-
19 vaccination providers, the 
order for COVID
-
19 vaccines, the storage of COVID
-
19 vaccines, management, administration (i.e
. 
reconstitution, use of adjuvants and administration techniques), etc. will be available in a variety of 
formats.
 
The main messages will include, but not be limited to the known and unknown about the COVID
-
19 
vaccine, the status of the outbreak, the vacci
ne availability, the effectiveness of prevention measures and 
the next steps to follow.

Upon provider enrollment, training will be provided on the subject.  The Immunization Program Health 
Educator, Medical Consultant or designee will be available to provide support to all providers.  Also, 
messages thru the IIS or education materi

available 
immediately 
in the form previously established.
 
Vaccine Information Statements
 
P

19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring
 
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporti
ng System
 
The Immunization Program has an appointed and experienced VAERS coordinator, and  provides annual 
trainings to the 500 plus current and new private and public (VFC/VFA) vaccine providers regarding 
responsibilities on reporting electronic in VAERS
 
adverse events following a vaccination and/or reporting 
clinically important adverse events even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event.  A system 
is also in place to receive non electronic reports. In addition, since 2019, VFC providers
 
are required use 
of IIS and report to VAERS and the Immunization Program for the Prevention of Perinatal Hepatitis B 
infections.  
 
The Immunization Program is currently developing a virtual presentation explaining new providers what 
VAERS is and how to us
e the system as well as making sure that there will be additional personnel to 
complete alternatively an emailed VAERS form or a telephone report into the system at the central office. 
 
The Immunization Program Incident Command structure will have a dedica
ted VAERS Safety coordinator 
and an alternate identified under direct supervision of the Incident Commander.  He/she will implement 
COVID
-
19 vaccine reporting requirements, prepare status reports, maintain situational awareness and 
keep leadership informed
 
on possible safety problems.

19 Vaccination Program Monitoring
 
The PR Immunization Program Evaluator will assist the Immunization Incident Commander, Area 
Commande
rs and coordinate with Department Operations Center Plans Section in developing 
procedures 
for monitoring various critical program planning and implementation elements, including performance 
targets, resources, staffing, and activities.
  
 
 
PRDoH Dashboards
 
 
 
PRDoH leadership will provide situational awareness for stakeholders and the general public throughout 
the COVID
-
19 vaccination response.  PRDoH Department Operations Center has dashboard capability.  
The 
Immunization Program ICS structure will appoint a
 
Planning Section Chief with responsibility to plan the 
use of situational awareness tools including a dashboard. The 
PR Immunization Program will employ the 
HHS Tiberius Analytic Support software to produce vaccination reports and generate a dashboard 
cap
ability if applicable.  At this stage in the planning process, it uncertain which dashboard will be used, 
regardless of platform used, PRDoH will have this capability enabled.  The purpose of the dashboard is to 
facilitate data sharing and readily availabl
e information in the decision making process.  
The PR COVID
-
19 
Dashboard will include information but not limited to:  
 
-
 
estimates of critical population categories
 
-
 
number and attributes of healthcare providers and facilities
 
-
 
geo
-
location of target populati
on and providers
 
-
 
number of enrolled COVID
-
19 vaccination providers
 
-
 
vaccine supply and distribution
 
-
 
vaccine administration data per locations and region
 
-
 
vaccine administration data by group, locations and cumulative, 1
st
 
and 2
nd
 
doses
 
-
 
approved re
-
distributi
on centers approved and locations
 
-
 
total number of adverse events  
 
-
 
order allocation and shipment tracking
 
-
 
extramural events
 
Information from each of the variables planned to be monitored in the dashboard originates in another 
software (i.e. VTrckS, IIS) an
d will be integrated into Tiberius.  These software will be used individually as 
back
-
up for redundancy.  The PR Immunization Program anticipates that the COVID
-
19 Vaccination 
Response Dashboard will be implemented in stages, and pending the arrival of the
 
Tiberius software SME.  
Tiberius account access privileges for internal and external organizations will be commensurate with 
specific role and use of the system.  The frequency of the dashboard reports most likely will be on a weekly 
basis, however indivi
dual category reports will be adjusted to meet operational demands.
 
 
In the initial implementation phase and prior to vaccine arrivals, the PR Immunization Program 
concentrate all efforts in provider enrollment activities.  The Immunization Program Directo
r or designee 
will obtain data on a weekly basis and keep count of number of providers enrolled per region and plan 
new objectives and strategies accordingly.

Another key element sought by the PR Immunization Program is to guarantee access to COVID
-
19 
va
ccination services by population in all phases of implementation. For example, the Vaccine Manager or 
designee will generate comparative reports between the amount of vaccine order
 
(through V
TrckS
) and 
the number of vaccines administered by provider. Anoth
er report or mapping that can be generated will 
be doses administered by municipality or suburb compared to location of target groups.
 
 
IIS system performance monitoring is another essential component designated system performance.  
Designated IIS Manager 

including file generation and data exchange to IZ Gateway. Provider
-
level data reporting will monitored 
remotely through IIS through data entry staff, frequency to be determined. 
 
 
Vaccine ordering and distribution will be monitored through a report that each provider has to fill.  This 
report, tracked by Vaccine Manager, include the amount of requisite vaccine and the amount they actually 
received. 
  
All the doses administered must
 
be registered in the IIS regardless the type of facility or 
provider.  The second dose reminder will be particularly traced through the IIS, EHR and, if funds available, 
we may outsource a 24/7 call center.
 
 
Resources Monitoring 
 
 
PRDoH and delegated divis
ions and programs will regularly monitor their resources to avoid unexpected 
mishaps to the progress of their COVID
-
19 Vaccination Programs.  The PR Immunization Program Director, 
Immunization Incident Commander or designee will ensure the following are ad
equately sourced and 
available: 
 
 
-
 
staffing: trained with identified back
-
up personnel to provide continuity of operations
 
-
 
equipment: fully functional and assigned 
 
-
 
supplies: timely replenishments
 
-
 
facilities: dedicated safe work space
 
-
 
budget: accounts assig
ned and quarterly reports
 
-
 
communications equipment: computer, internet and radio communications   
 
Messaging 
 
PRDoH and its divisions and programs will provide timely messaging throughout the COVID
-
19 vaccination 
response.  PRDoH Communications Office will
 
have primary responsibility with SME inputs from PR 
Immunization Program, Epidemiology and other as required to generate directed messaging.  Message 
deployment will be coordinated thru EOC Public Information Officers at all levels.  Most likely, a Joint 
Information Center will be established to synchronize messaging across all jurisdictions and agencies to 
avoid confusion.  Stakeholders and general public should routinely monitor both PRDoH and State level 
messaging to inform their communications efforts.
  
Messaging must be clear, current, and received as 
intended by the audience. Monitoring social media can be helpful in assessing message delivery and 
reception and dispelling inaccurate information.
 
 
In case of media campaign and announcements, message de
livery will be monitored through a media 
report generated by the media agency contracted.   This report will include the delivery of the educational 
and promotional messages disseminated throughout specified media platforms available in PR and will be

ted for contract adherence prior to payments made.  Reception of communication messages and 
materials among target audiences throughout jurisdiction will be analyzed against increment in 
population vaccinated.
  
COVID

Situational Awareness
 
 
COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program staff will collaborate closely with offices/divisions/pr
ograms inside the 
PRDoH, governmental agencies and private external partners to execute program strategies and activities 
and monitor its progress, achievement and impact.  PRDoH Emergency Operations Center will facilitate 

munication.  Under the planning section, the situation unit will be 
responsible for collecting, processing, organizing and disseminating ongoing and up
-
to
-
date situational 
awareness information and operations status to all stakeholders through summaries, m
aps and graphics. 
 
The activation of the ICS structure, by PRDoH will facilitate the implementation of the concept 
Management by Objectives including the following: 
 
 
-
 
Establishing specific, measurable objectives
 
-
 
Identifying strategies, tactics, tasks, and
 
activities to achieve the objectives
 
-
 
Developing and issuing assignments, plans, procedures, and protocols for various incident 
management functional elements to accomplish the identified tasks
 
-
 
Documenting results against the objectives to measure performa
nce, facilitate corrective actions, 
and inform development of incident objectives for the subsequent operational period
 
 
Internally, COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program staff will receive input from enrolled providers and 
immunization program staff (i.e. regional
 
coordinators). Inside the PRDoH, a close collaboration and direct 
communication has already been established with the Office of Epidemiology and Research, Office of 
Preparedness and Coordination of Public Health Response, and Division of
 
Children with Med
ical Special 
Needs, among others. These internal partners are already leading and executing activities related to 
COVID
-
19 testing, contact tracing and surveillance system.
 
Partnerships with government agencies such as the Police and Fire Departments and t
he Bureau of 
Emergency and Disaster Management will facilitate local situational awareness input since they have 
offices and staff in all 78 municipalities. Also, COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program staff will establish 
collaboration with private external partner
s, such as the PR Immunization Coalition, PR Community 
Pharmacies Association and PR Primary Care Association, to share/receive local situational awareness 
input through their members.

  September 1, 2021
 Dear Fellow Arkansans,
  As Governor of the State of Arkansas and in accordance with the provisions
 of
 Arkansa
s Code
 Annotated
 12-75-101 et seq.,
 I am responsible
 for
 the welfare
 and
 safety
 of
 citizens
 residing
 in
 the
 state.
 Toward
 this
 objective,
 I have directed preparation and 
periodic review of the Arkansas Comprehensive 
Emergency
 Management
 Plan
 (ARCEMP).
  Thi
s plan describes how resources of local, state, and federal governments may be 
most effectively used to ensure that the state is prepared for all hazards. It also describes 
how responders will react efficiently to save lives and property and alleviate suff
ering 
when disaster occurs.
  Responsibilities for specific emergency support functions are assigned to 
appropriate state agencies by an Executive Order describing implementation of 
Emergency Support Functions (ESF).
  This plan and changes to it are effecti
ve upon publication to the Arkansas 
Division of Emergency Management web page 
 https://www.dps.arkansas.gov
/emergency
-man
agemen
t /ade

The Director of the 
Arkansas Division of Emergency Management publishes th
is plan and will issue changes 
or corrections as required.

1  Basic Plan
     Overview
 Int
roduction
 This Basic Plan section of the Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (ARCEMP) is an 
overview of how the State conducts all
-hazards incident response. It defines the responsibilities of local, 
State and federal governments and the reso
urces brought to response by volunteer agencies and the 
private sector. It also provides broad guidance to State agencies and outlines the aid and assistance 
available to local and State governments in the event of an emergency.
 The ARCEMP is intended to b
e flexible so that following the plan doesn™t encumber the response, 
scalable so that response is appropriate to the magnitude of the event, and adaptable to address the 
changes that occur during an event.
 This Basic Plan Section briefs on the coordination
 of roles and responsibilities across the State. It 
captures specific authorities and capabilities for managing incidents that range from the serious, but 
purely local, to large
-scale terrorist attacks or catastrophic natural disasters.
 The ARCEMP is alway
s in effect and can be implemented as needed to improve response. This plan 
supersedes any previous Arkansas Emergency Operations Plan. Anyone reading any part of the ARCEMP 
should be familiar with this Basic Plan section.
   Distribution
 The ARCEMP is publ
ished to the ADEM website. The plan is written and maintained by ADEM for 
government decision makers, private sector business and nongovernmental stakeholders, and 
emergency management practitioners. Readers are encouraged to recommend improvement or 
appro
priate changes to this plan. Suggestions can be made through the ADEM website at 
https://www.dps.arkansas.gov/emergency
-management/adem/about
-adem/contact
-us
-2/.  Basic Plan, Pg. 
2  Purpose
   This plan is written to outline the State services provided under the sixteen Emergency Support 
Functions (ESFs). This includes the identification, mobilization, and coordination of available State 
owned, private industry and volunteer equi
pment, manpower, and technical expertise. The plan outlines 
the roles and responsibilities taken by these entities to provide essential emergency services in the 
event of an emergency or
 disaster.
 More specifically, the purpose of the Arkansas Comprehensiv
e Emergency Management Plan is to:
  Develop an all
-hazards planning approach that will address all threats,
 emergencies 
or disasters that may impact
 Arkansas.
  Create the general planning structure for prevention, protection,
 response, 
recovery, and mitigati
on activities at the State
 level.
  Reduce vulnerability to loss of life and damage to property resulting from
 natural, 
technological, and manmade
 disasters.
  Describe the State™s role in supporting local governments during an emergency
 or 
disaster.
  Describe 
the State and federal relationship during response and
 recovery 
operations.
  Describe the various types of disasters which are likely to occur 
- from local events 
to catastrophic
 disasters.
  Describe the actions that the State Emergency Support Functions wil
l initiate in 
coordination with county and federal
 counterparts.
  Describe the mechanisms to deliver immediate assistance, including direction
 and 
control of intrastate, interstate and federal response and recovery
 assistance.
  Describe the State™s incorpora
tion of the tenets of the National
 Incident 
Management System
 (NIMS).
  Incorporate the core capabilities developed under Presidential Policy Directive
 8 (PPD
-8) which were revised and defined in the National Preparedness Goal, 
September
 2015.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
3  Scope
   The A
RCEMP establishes guidelines to aid in the use of resources, processing of requests, and 
coordinating the management of each ESF™s resources. The guidance comes from assisting agencies and 
private industry. It considers determinations of the priority of in
frastructure and other repair, damage 
assessments, and appropriate emergency management coordination among State agencies, local 
jurisdictions, and neighboring States.
 The ARCEMP provides structures, based upon NIMS, for implementing State
-level policy and
 operational 
coordination for domestic incident response. It can be partially or fully implemented in the context of a 
threat, in anticipation of a significant event or in response to an incident. Selective implementation 
allows for a scaled response, deli
very of the exact resources needed, and a level of coordination 
appropriate to each event.
 In this document, an ‚incident™ or ‚event™ includes the threat, expectation, or occurrence of emergency 
or disaster regardless of its cause. Since the causes of even
ts range from accidents and natural disasters 
to terrorist attacks, the ARCEMP addresses operations from an all
-hazards perspective.
 The hazards faced by Arkansas are discussed in detail in the Mitigation Annex, State of Arkansas All
- Hazards Mitigation Pl
an, September 2018. The Mitigation Annex is maintained under separate cover and 
is available 
through
 the ADEM Mitigation Branch. It identifies Arkansas™ ten natural and four manmade 
and other hazards on page 4
-2 (34 of 26
8).
 The ARCEMP is intended to accelerate the State™s capacity to rapidly assess and respond to incidents 
that require State assistance. In practice, many incidents require immediate activation of interagency 
coordination protocols to prevent the incident f
rom becoming worse or to surge more aggressively to 
contain it. A State department or agency acting on independent authority may be the initial and the 
primary State responder, but incidents that require more systematic State response efforts are actively 
coordinated through the appropriate mechanisms described in this document and in its supporting 
annexes.
   Situation
   Natural disasters, most often flooding and severe weather, and other events have occurred in Arkansas 
with some regularity in the past an
d are expected to occur in the future.
 Events can place unusual demands upon local jurisdictions and require additional resources.
 Arkansas Division of Emergency Management is charged with coordinating prevention of, protection 
from, response to, recovery 
from, and mitigation of hazards that cannot be effectively controlled at the 
local level.
 Disasters and emergencies can occur without warning or may escalate to unexpected levels of severity.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
4  Assumptions
   The Director of ADEM will act for the Governor of
 Arkansas to coordinate disaster and emergency 
response.
 All disasters are local. The resources of the affected local jurisdiction will be depleted before assistance 
is requested from the State.
 Before requesting assistance from the State, local government
s will seek assistance through mutual aid 
arrangements with their neighboring jurisdictions and the private sector.
 Each Emergency Support Function Coordinating Agency is prepared to report to the SEOC as required by 
the nature of the disaster and Executiv
e Order 20
-02. The federal government will provide funds and assistance to areas of the State declared to be major 
disaster areas by the President. Federal agencies may provide assistance under their statutory authority 
to States affected by disaster witho
ut Presidential declaration.
    Incident Management
   Arkansas has formally adopted the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS) 
as the template for 
managing incidents.
 Local jurisdictions overwhelmed by event(s) are obligated to coordinate with State, F
ederal and private 
sector support teams. Each layer of government must use its capabilities effectively in support of the 
other layers. They must complement each other for their separate actions to result in achievement of a 
common goal. The NIMS Incident 
Command System (ICS) offers a proven structure to create an effective 
team from very diverse members.
 It is important that the ARCEMP accurately reflects the capabilities of each level of government and that 
each entity performs according to the general ro
les outlined in the ARCEMP. Toward this end, each ESF 
is encouraged to present its capabilities as realistically as possible in its annex.
 Each organization or level of government has an obligation to continuously improve its own core 
capabilities.
 Arkansa
s makes every effort to include public sector agencies, private sector businesses and 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in all aspects of planning.
 Local jurisdictions, States, the Federal Government and our private sector partners must each 
understand 
their respective roles and responsibilities. Below is a brief summary of emergency 
management roles.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
5  Individuals and Families
 Resilient communities begin with prepared individuals and families and the leadership and engagement 
of local government and the 
private sector. Individuals, families and caregivers to those with special 
needs should enhance their awareness of risk and threats, develop family emergency plans that include 
care for pets and companion animals and prepare emergency supply kits. Individu
als can also volunteer 
in their communities.
   Local Jurisdictions
 Local police, fire, public health and medical providers, emergency management, public works, 
environmental response professionals and others in the local jurisdiction are often the first to
 detect or 
respond to a threat, hazard, or emergency. They also are often the last to leave an incident site or 
otherwise to cope with the persistent effects of an incident.
 Local governments are closest to those impacted by natural disasters, and have alw
ays had the lead in 
response and recovery. The local Chief Elected Official (the County Judge, Mayor, or City Manager) is 
responsible for ensuring the public safety and welfare. Senior officials and their emergency managers 
build core capabilities for an e
ffective response. They organize and integrate their resources with 
neighboring jurisdictions, the State and the private sector. Private sector businesses are vital partners 
within local jurisdictions.
   State
 The State is a sovereign entity and the Govern
or has the primary responsibility for the safety and 
welfare of its residents. The Governor also has the authority to determine the manner in which State 
response will be funded.
 The State has significant resources and a robust ability to respond to emerge
ncy or disaster. The role of 
State government in most events is to supplement local response capability before, during, and after 
incidents. During incident response, the State plays a key role by coordinating the resources and 
capabilities of entities out
side the affected local jurisdiction. This potentially gives the affected area 
access to the resources of every State agency. Arkansas has access to the resources of other States in 
FEMA R6 (Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico) through the
 Interstate Emergency 
Response Support Plan (IERSP). Arkansas can request assistance from every State and possession of the
 U.S.
 through its membership in the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). The Governor 
has the option to request assistance from
 the federal government if its assets are
 needed.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
6  The Federal Government
 The Federal Government maintains a wide array of capabilities and resources that can be made available 
upon request of the Governor. When response needs exceed State and local resour
ces, the Federal 
Government provides resources and capabilities to support the State response. More specific 
information can be found in the Response Federal Interagency Operational Plan, Second Edition, August 
2016.
   The Private Sector
 The private sector
 includes for
-profit businesses, trade associations and non
-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), not
-for
-profit enterprises, faith
-based organizations and other voluntary 
organizations. The private sector also includes individual citizens and families who ca
n significantly 
impact the outcome of any event by being prepared for emergencies.
 Private sector businesses play an essential role in protecting critical infrastructure and restoring normal 
operations after a disruption. This mitigates the impact of a dis
aster or emergency and accelerates the 
pace of recovery for local jurisdictions and the nation.
 The private sector contributes to response efforts by partnering with government to assess threats, 
evaluate risks and mitigate identified hazards. The private 
sector plays a vital role in effective response 
by performing essential service missions within local jurisdictions.
 Private sector entities are encouraged to develop plans to ensure the continuity of their operations as 
well as plans to participate in dis
aster response. They are urged to involve State and local planners so 
that government and private sector response actions come together effectively.
   Incident Response
   The Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan is Emergency Support Function (E
SF)-based. 
The State has developed capabilities and identified resources that may be required based on hazard 
identification and risk assessment.
 The State prioritizes incident response activities with respect to the lifelines described in the National 
Res
ponse Framework. The seven lifelines provide indispensable service that enables the continuous 
operation of critical business and government functions, and is critical to human health and safety, or to 
economic security. Attention to the Lifelines promotes
 a response that facilitates unity of purpose and 
better communication amongst the whole community (Federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local 
governments, and private sector and non
-governmental entities). Applying the lifelines construct allows 
decis
ion
-makers to prioritize, sequence, and focus response efforts towards maintaining or restoring the 
most critical services and infrastructure. The seven lifelines are:

  Basic Plan, Pg. 
8  Organization of the Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency Manage
ment Plan
   The plan has been approved by the Governor of Arkansas who is the Promulgation Authority. That 
approval is conveyed by the Governor™s Letter which is included in the ARCEMP.
 The ARCEMP includes this Basic Plan, which describes the principles th
at guide the State™s response, 
roles and responsibilities. It also includes supplemental documents that provide more detailed 
information to assist practitioners in implementing the ARCEMP. Those supplemental documents 
include the current
  State of Arkansas
 All

 Plan
  State of Arkansas Recovery

  Arkansas Division of Emergency Management Continuity of Operations
 Plan
  Arkansas State EOC
 Plan
  Arkansas Continuity of Government
 Plan
  Procedures for implementing the ARCEMP apply to its compani
on plans listed above unless otherwise 
noted in those documents. The procedures support operational priorities of life, safety, health, property 
protection, environmental protection, restoration of essential utilities, restoration of essential program 
func
tions and coordination among appropriate stakeholders. The implementing procedures are 
discussed in detail in the Incident Management section of this Basic Plan.
 ESF Annexes group State resources and capabilities into sixteen functional areas that are most
 frequently needed in a State response (e.g. Transportation, Firefighting, and Mass Care). Each functional 
area, or ESF, is coordinated by a department or agency. The ESF Annexes discuss the knowledge, skills, 
and abilities of the various State departments
 and agencies. ESF Annexes describe State resource 
management functions before, during and after an incident.
 Support Annexes describe less direct, but still essential, functions that augment State response and are 
common to most incidents (e.g., Financial
 Management, Volunteer and Donations Management, Private 
Sector Coordination). These annexes provide additional detail for the ARCEMP.
 Incident Annexes address the unique aspects of response to particular incidents or types of incidents. 
For example: In mo
st incidents, ADEM takes the lead in dissemination of public information. In a 
pandemic or nuclear/radiological incident, the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) leads that function 
because the health implications from such an event are unique to that type
 of incident and ADH has the 
necessary subject matter expertise to address those issues.
 Organization by ESF provides the structure for coordinating the resources of many State agencies as 
they respond to an incident. Capabilities typically required in res
ponse are grouped into ‚functions™ and 
overseen by a coordinating entity with a seat in the SEOC. This streamlines support to local jurisdictions 
by increasing situational awareness within each function and between the functions represented in the 
SEOC for
 any given event.
 The formal planning process for the ARCEMP is as described in Comprehensive Planning Guidance 101 
published and recommended by FEMA.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
9  After the ARCEMP is posted to the ADEM website each year, notification is made to all interested 
parties
. At that time the interested parties are offered an additional opportunity to submit any 
comments or changes they may have.
   Concept of Operations
   The primary objective of response activities centers upon saving lives and protecting property. Incidents
 must be managed at the most local jurisdictional level possible and must be supported by additional 
jurisdictions as needed. It is not necessary that each level become overwhelmed, or fail, prior to surging 
resources from another level. Response at every 
level must ‚lean forward™ to have resources in place 
ahead of the disaster.
 Most incidents begin and end locally and are wholly managed at the local level. Many incidents require 
additional resources or support from across the jurisdiction, and some requir
e additional support from 
neighboring jurisdictions or the State. A few require Federal support. State response protocols recognize 
this and are structured to provide assistance on the appropriate scale. During large
-scale events, all 
levels will take proa
ctive measures to respond, anticipating resources that may be required.
 In incidents involving multiple jurisdictions or a single jurisdiction with multiagency involvement, 
Arkansas implements unified command. Unified command allows agencies with different
 legal, 
geographic, and functional authorities and responsibilities to work together effectively. Each 
participating agency maintains its own authority, responsibility and accountability. The ARCEMP 
employs the NIMS structures and tools including unified c
ommand.
 The unified command concept is distinct from the military chain of command. Military forces do not 
operate under the authority of the Incident Commander or under the unified command structure.
   Part of a Broader Strategy
   The ARCEMP focuses on th
e preparedness activities that are directly related to an evolving incident or 
potential incident rather than the steady
-state preparedness or readiness activities conducted in the 
absence of a specific threat or hazard. It does not try to include all of t
hese larger efforts. The 
preparedness activities discussed in the ARCEMP are one part of the State™s overall strategy.
 The State™s broad strategy includes building and maintaining skills in alignment with the 32 core 
capabilities described in the National 
Preparedness Goal. Core capabilities are essential for the 
execution of each of the five mission areas: prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
10  Roles and Responsibilities
   This section provides an overview of the core stakeholders res
ponsible for emergency management at 
the local and State levels. More specific information can be found in local plans, State and local 
statutes, and in the approximately 55 documents referenced in various locations throughout this plan.
   Local Jurisdicti
ons
 The responsibility for responding to emergencies and disasters, both natural and manmade, begins at 
the local level with citizens and public officials in the county, city or town affected by the event. Local 
government has the responsibility for provid
ing mass care and for coordinating the various agencies 
and organizations that normally provide assistance to victims and emergency response personnel. Local 
leaders and emergency managers prepare to manage incidents locally.
   Chief Elected or Appointed O
fficial. 
The County Judges, the City Manager of Little Rock, and the Mayor 
of North Little Rock are the chief elected officials of Arkansas™ designated emergency management 
jurisdictions. Although their roles require providing direction and guidance to con
stituents during an 
incident, their day
-to-day activities do not necessarily focus on emergency management and incident 
response. The chief elected official can declare that a State of emergency exists within the jurisdiction 
so that State disaster relief 
can be utilized. The chief elected official is also the person who will make a 
decision to evacuate an affected area should the situation require it.
 Chief elected or appointed officials must have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities 
for successful emergency management and incident response. Any incident can have a mix of 
political, economic, social, environmental, public health and financial implications with potentially 
serious long
- term effects.
 To better serve their constituents, e
lected and appointed officials are depended upon to do 
the following:
    Understand, commit to, and receive training on NIMS and participate in exercises. 
  Maintain an understanding of basic emergency management, continuity of operations 
and continuity of g
overnment plans, jurisdictional response capabilities, and initiation 
of disaster declarations. 
  Lead and encourage preparedness efforts within the community, agencies of the 
jurisdiction, NGOs, and the private sector, as appropriate. 
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
11   Help to establish re
lationships (including mutual aid agreements and assistance 
agreements) with other jurisdictions and, as appropriate, NGOs and the private 
sector. 
  Support and encourage participation in mitigation efforts within the jurisdiction and, 
as appropriate, with 
NGOs and the private sector. 
  Provide guidance to their jurisdictions, departments, and/or agencies, with clearly 
stated policies for NIMS implementation. 
  Understand laws and regulations in their jurisdictions that pertain to emergency 
management and inci
dent response. 
  Maintain awareness of critical infrastructure and key resources within their 
jurisdictions, potential incident impacts, and restoration priorities. 
  The chief elected official is the head of the local government, which regulates building c
odes and 
land use matters.
 Activation of the local EOC, coordination of multiple operations, requests for outside assistance and 
initiation of local emergency broadcasts all occur under the direction of the chief elected or 
appointed official. Local jurisd
iction leaders also work closely with their Congressional 
representatives during emergencies and on an ongoing basis regarding local preparedness, 
capabilities and needs.
   Emergency Manager. 
The local emergency manager has the day
-to-day responsibility of
 overseeing 
emergency management programs and activities. He or she works with elected and appointed 
officials to ensure that the local jurisdiction™s emergency response plans and activities accurately 
reflect the plans and capabilities of the stakeholders
. This role typically encompasses all aspects of a 
jurisdiction™s mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities.
 The Local Emergency Management Coordinator (LEMC) typically oversees all components of the 
emergency management pro
gram for the local jurisdiction. The duties of the LEMC commonly 
include the following:
  Coordinate the planning process and work cooperatively with local agencies and private 
sector enterprises. 
  Oversee assessments of damage resulting from an incident. 
  Maintain awareness of the availability and readiness of local capabilities. Emergency 
managers will recognize the jurisdiction™s shortfalls and direct efforts to eliminate them.
    Basic Plan, Pg. 
12   Advise and inform local officials about emergency management activities, to i
nclude 
providing situational awareness during an incident. 
  Develop and execute public awareness and education programs. 
  Involve private sector businesses, NGOs, and relief organizations in planning, training and 
exercises.
  Serve as the jurisdiction
™s media liaison and/or public affairs spokesperson.
 Department and Agency Heads. 
Department and agency heads collaborate with the emergency 
manager to develop the local emergency ope
rations plan and to acquire key emergency management 
resources. Participation in the planning process ensures that specific capabilities (i.e., firefighting, law 
enforcement, emergency medical services and public works) are integrated into a usable plan to
 serve 
the local jurisdiction.
 These department and agency heads develop internal policies and procedures that support the 
jurisdiction™s response and recovery plans and needs. They participate in interagency training and 
exercising to evaluate and improve
 their capabilities.
   Private Sector Businesses and NGOs
 Each private sector entity that participates in emergency response is encouraged to appoint an 
Emergency Management Liaison Officer (EMLO) who will coordinate its emergency response activities 
with 
the SEOC and with its local jurisdiction.
   Businesses. 
Businesses are encouraged to engage in continuity planning and to share those plans with 
local government.
 Businesses 
- private sector for
-profit enterprises 
- are critical to both response and recove
ry. Businesses 
have goods on site that can be used to sustain response activities. Functioning businesses bring tax 
dollars and economic stability to communities that might otherwise fail to rebound from a disaster.
 Much of the nation™s critical infrastruc
ture 
Œ the systems that allow large numbers of people to live in 
close proximity to each other 
Œ is owned by businesses. Failure of these systems is a disaster regardless 
of the cause. Damage to infrastructure often impacts well beyond the immediate disast
er area.
 Businesses control, and sometimes are, key resources essential to minimal operation of the economy 
and the government.
   Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) and Volunteer Agencies (VolAgs). 
NGOs are urged to prepare 
for the roles they intend to p
lay in emergency and disaster and to include the appropriate level of 
government in the process.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
13  NGOs are not for
-profit and not government. The group is predominantly made up of volunteer 
agencies (VolAgs). VolAgs ordinarily prepare to respond to disaste
r rather than to survive the direct 
impact of an event. VolAgs focus their efforts on individuals and families. The VolAgs support response 
efforts and particularly the functions of ESF #6 
Œ Mass Care, Emergency Assistance, Housing, and Human 
Services.
 The
y provide sheltering, emergency food supplies, counseling services and other vital support services 
to disaster survivors. Some provide specialized services to individuals with disabilities and some 
provide mental health services to help survivors overcome
 the trauma associated with a life
-changing 
or life
- threatening event.
 NGOs are independent and committed to specific interests and values. These interests and values 
are reflected in the resources they provide. NGOs augment efforts at all levels of respo
nse.
 The State coordinates its response with that of the Arkansas Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters 
(ARVOAD). ARVOAD is a group of charitable organizations 
- both faith based and secular 
Œ who provide 
relief to citizens affected by disaster. ARVO
AD maintains situational awareness of its members™ disaster 
response activities through regular and frequent conference calls to which they invite representatives 
of emergency management. ARVOAD also has a seat in the SEOC. The members of ARVOAD and other 
NGOs make invaluable contributions to disaster response.
   State
 Disaster assistance provided by the State is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, relief that can 
be provided by local governments.
 Governor. 
The Governor is responsible for meeting and
 mitigating, to the maximum extent possible, 
dangers to the people and property of the State presented or threatened by disasters. The Governor 
may issue executive orders, proclamations, and regulations 
Œ which have the force of law 
- and 
amend or rescind 
them.
 Current legislation in force names five distinct funds within the Office of the Governor. The statute 
also stipulates the size and use of each one; including specifically that one fund 
- the Governor™s 
Disaster Fund 
- may be increased from time to ti
me at the discretion of the Governor.
 The Governor is Commander
-in-Chief of all forces available for emergency duty. To the greatest 
extent practicable, the Governor delegates operational control by executive order or regulation prior 
to disaster emergency
, but can also do so during the event. Additionally, the Governor may exercise 
the following powers.
  Suspend the provisions of any regulatory statutes prescribing the procedures for conduct of 
State business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any Sta
te agency, if strict compliance 
with the provisions of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, 
or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency;
  Utilize all available resources of the State government and of each pol
itical subdivision of the 
State as reasonably necessary to cope with the disaster emergency;
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
14   Transfer the direction, personnel, or functions of State departments and agencies or units of 
State departments and agencies for the purpose of performing or facil
itating emergency 
management;
  Subject to any applicable requirements for compensation under Arkansas Code Annotated § 
12-75-124, commandeer or utilize any private property if he or she finds this necessary to 
cope with the disaster emergency;
  Direct and co
mpel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or 
threatened area within the State if the Governor deems this action necessary for the 
preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response, or recovery;
  Prescribe routes, modes
 of transportation, and destinations in connection with evacuation;
  Control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, the movement of persons within the 
area, and the occupancy of premises therein;
  Suspend or limit the sale, dispensing, or transporta
tion of alcoholic beverages, firearms, 
explosives, and combustibles; and
  Make provision for the availability and use of temporary emergency housing.
 Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM). 
ADEM is responsible for coordinating the State 
and federa
l response to emergency or disaster when local governments reach or anticipate exhaustion 
of their capabilities. ADEM will:
  Lead the State™s disaster/emergency response planning and coordination.
  Advise the Governor, government officials and local governme
nts as to the nature, magnitude 
and possible effects of the disasters and emergencies likely to affect Arkansas.
  Dispatch an Area Coordinator to each incident to evaluate the situation, coordinate State 
activities with local governments and advise the SEOC
 first hand of the situation.
  Provide advice and assistance on emergency operations plans, public information, training 
programs, funding, exercises and proper administration of local programs to State agencies, 
local governments, and private sector.
  Coord
inate the response functions of State government.
  Function as liaison with federal and private agencies.
  Maintain all capabilities necessary to operate the SEOC.
  Coordinate planning and response operations with adjoining States.
  Maintain the ARCEMP as requ
ired by law and to the standards set by the Emergency 
Management Accreditation Program (EMAP). 
    Basic Plan, Pg. 
15   Train and exercise SEOC staff on software and operating procedures as needed.
  Staff the Arkansas Response and Coordination Center (ARCC) in North Little Rock tw
enty
-four 
hours a day. 
  Maintain the primary National Alert Warning System (NAWAS) warning point at the ARCC and 
receive warning information.
  Coordinate efforts to keep the population informed of developing situations, recommend 
appropriate protective acti
ons, control rumors and speculation, and to release general 
information for the safety and welfare of the State.
  Direct damage assessment and recovery programs. ADEM will compile preliminary damage 
estimates and complete a damage assessment report.  
  Assis
t the Governor in requests for Presidential disaster or emergency declarations.
  Assist the federal government in the delivery of its assistance programs.  
  Establish and operate Disaster Recovery Centers as needed.
  Administer State assistance programs.
  Coo
rdinate and promote emergency response training throughout the State.
  Advise local governments in the development of exercise and training programs
 State departments and agencies. 
The Arkansas departments, agencies, commissions, and offices having 
roles in
 emergency response also participate in prevention, protection, mitigation, and recovery.
 As provided in Arkansas Code Annotated § 12
-75-116, each State agency has appointed an Emergency 
Management Liaison Officer (EMLO). The EMLO is ADEM™s point of contac
t at that agency.
 In addition, certain agencies have been assigned responsibility for coordination of an Emergency 
Support Function under the Governor™s Executive Order 20
-02. Each of these has a point of contact (ESF 
POC) who may or may not be the EMLO to
 ADEM. Many agencies appoint the same person to both 
positions. The difference is that the area of expertise for the ESF POC is specifically ESF issues. The area 
of expertise for the EMLO is typically anything to do with the agency.
 Administration and Logi
stics. 
The Director, Arkansas Division of Emergency Management, in 
coordination with the Director, Department of Finance and Administration (DFA), will facilitate resource 
support for statewide emergency operations. At both State and local levels, actions 
will be taken to 
establish orderly files or directives and forms so that during a disaster this information will be readily 
available. All State property and supplies will be adequately accounted for and protected.
 Any purchases that must be made for disas
ter will be made through the Department of Transformation 
and Shared Services, Office of Procurement and in accordance with the policies listed in ESF #7 
Œ Resource Support.
 Current Memoranda of Understanding and similar agreements that address administrat
ion and logistics 
issues will be filed and readily available at all times.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
16  State authorities will keep a record of labor and equipment used to cope with a disaster. ADEM will use 
this record and the records of local jurisdictions to determine State and lo
cal contributions in requesting 
Presidential disaster declaration.
 Federal
 When an incident response requires more resources than affected local and State jurisdictions possess 
Œ or when an incident is managed by federal departments or agencies acting unde
r their own authorities 
Œ the Federal Government organizes and deploys its department and agency capabilities. It coordinates 
the federal response and the assistance of response partners. The National Response Framework offers 
a comprehensive description o
f the federal response to disaster/emergency.
 Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. 
The Governor can request assistance 
under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) when it is clear 
tha
t State capabilities will be exhausted. The Stafford Act authorizes the President to provide assistance 
to State and local governments, certain private nonprofit organizations and individuals. Stafford Act 
assistance is aimed at supporting response, recove
ry and mitigation efforts following Presidential 
emergency or disaster declarations.
 For events in which a Stafford Act declaration is expected, such as an approaching hurricane, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security or the FEMA Administrator may designate on
e or more federal officials 
to coordinate with the State Coordinating Officer (SCO). Together they will determine resources and 
actions that will likely be required, and begin deployment of assets.
 A Presidential 
major disaster declaration 
puts into motion
 long
-term federal recovery programs. The 
programs are designed to help disaster victims, businesses, and public entities and some are matched by 
State programs. An 
emergency declaration 
is more limited in scope and without the long
-term federal 
recovery p
rograms of a major disaster declaration. Generally, federal assistance and funding are 
provided to meet a specific emergency need or to help prevent a major disaster from occurring.
 Requesting a Presidential Declaration. 
The Governor may ask the President 
to declare a federal disaster 
or emergency when State and local resources are insufficient, only the Governor can initiate a request 
for a Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration. Prior to and during catastrophic events, 
especially for those w
hich occur without notice, the Federal Government may take proactive measures 
to mobilize and deploy assets in anticipation of a request from a State. Federal resources will arrive at a 
federal mobilization center or staging area. They will remain there un
til requested by local incident 
command through State authorities, when they are integrated into the incident response effort.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
17  Response Actions
   Four key actions typically occur in response to an emergency or disaster:
   Gain and Maintain Situational Awa
reness
 Situational awareness requires continuous monitoring of relevant sources of information regarding 
actual incidents and developing hazards.
 State Actions. 
The State will address the inherent challenges in establishing successful information
- sharing 
networks by:
  Maintaining an intelligence fusion center 
Œ one central location that brings together law 
enforcement, and other agencies to evaluate available information. 
  Collaborating with regional, multi
-state and federal systems to encourage intelligenc
e and 
information sharing. The State will utilize standards for information sharing that foster the 
ability of these systems to exchange data. 
  Reporting incident information using established mechanisms. 
  Immediately reporting threats and incidents with a
 potential or actual terrorist link to the FBI 
Little Rock Joint Terrorism Task Force. 
  Assess the Situation, Activate Resources and Capabilities
 When an incident occurs or potential incident exists, responders assess the situation, identify and 
prioritiz
e requirements and activate available resources and capabilities to save lives, protect property 
and meet basic human needs.
 When planning for heightened threats or in anticipation of large
-scale incidents, key activities include 
anticipating needs and pre
-positioning resources. Based on asset availability, resources can be pre
- positioned and response teams and other support resources may be placed on alert or deployed to a 
staging area.
 State Actions. 
In the event of an incident requiring a coordinated re
sponse, ESF #5 
Œ Emergency 
Management will:
  Identify staff for deployment to the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC). The SEOC has 
standard procedures and call
-down lists and will notify department and agency points of 
contact. 
  Coordinate the deploym
ent and activities of specialized response teams such as:  search and 
rescue teams, crime scene investigators, public works teams, hazardous materials response 
teams, public health specialists or veterinarians. 
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
18  Coordinate Response Actions
 Specific tasks i
nclude:
  Supporting local jurisdictions by mobilizing the National Guard, pre
-positioning assets and 
managing other State level emergency functions. 
  Implementing plans to ensure the effective management of the flow of volunteers and goods 
into the affected
 area. 
  Coordinating initial actions which may include provision of law enforcement, fire and 
emergency medical services; emergency flood fighting; evacuations; rerouting of ground, air, 
and/or water traffic; and provision of emergency information to the p
ublic. 
  Coordinating requests from both affected and assisting stakeholders for additional support. 
  Identifying and integrating resources and capabilities. 
  Coordinating communications between responders and coordinating public information 
Œ which may inc
lude creating a Joint Information Center (JIC). 
  Requesting assistance through the Interstate Emergency Response Support Plan (IERSP) or 
through EMAC.
  Requesting federal assistance.
 State Actions. 
The State will provide the vast majority of the external as
sistance to local jurisdictions. 
When an incident grows beyond the response capability of a local jurisdiction and its available mutual 
aid, the local jurisdiction contacts the State. Upon receiving a request for assistance from a local 
government which ha
s declared a disaster, the State begins to exercise its options to fill the request. 
Resources may come from State agencies, from local jurisdictions that have developed a particular 
capability, from volunteer and other private entities, from FEMA R6 State
s through the IERSP, from all 
other U.S. States and territories through EMAC, and from the federal government through its various 
agencies and international contacts.
 In addition to these actions, the Governor may elect to activate the Arkansas National Gu
ard. The 
Governor commands the State military forces (National Guard, when in State Active Duty or Title 32 
status) and can deploy these assets in response to an incident. National Guard forces employed under 
State Active Duty or Title 32 status are provid
ing support to the Governor of the State and are not part 
of federal military response efforts. The Arkansas National Guard only deploys at the request or with the 
permission of the Governor.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
19  When the National Guard is deployed in State Active Duty status
, the Governor retains command and 
control of forces inside the State. State Active Duty is based on State statute and policy, and the State is 
responsible for all costs relating to the deployment. State active
-duty missions are carried out by the 
Adjutant
 General (TAG) pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Governor as Commander
-in- Chief.
 Title 32 Full
-Time National Guard Duty refers to federal training or other duty, other than inactive duty, 
performed by a member of the National Guard. Title 32 
is not subject to 
posse comitatus 
restrictions 
which prohibit federal military personnel and units of the National Guard under federal authority from 
acting in a law enforcement capacity within the United States. Title 32 allows the Governor, with the 
appr
oval of the President or the Secretary of Defense, to order a Guard member to duty to:
  Perform training and other operational activities. 
  Undertake activities for the military protection of the territory or domestic population of the 
United States, or of 
the infrastructure or other assets of the United States determined to be 
critical to national security, from a threat or aggression against the United States. 
  Conduct homeland defense activities that the Secretary of Defense determines to be 
necessary and
 appropriate for participation by the National Guard units or members.
 Under Title 32, the National Guard is under State control at federal expense in the service of the federal 
government. Under Title 32, Governors answered the President™s request to depl
oy National Guard 
forces to the nation™s airports in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
 In rare circumstances, the President may federalize National Guard forces for domestic duties under 
Title 10. The President™s authorit
y with regard to mobilizing and deploying Federal Military Reserve 
components (e.g., the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard Title 10 Reserves) applies 
equally to the nation™s 
shared 
military component 
Œ the National Guard. In these cases, 
the forces are 
no longer under the command of the Governor. Instead, the Department of Defense assumes full 
responsibility for all aspects of the deployment, including command and control over National Guard 
forces.
 When performed within the United States,
 Title 10 duty is subject to numerous legal restrictions, 
including the Posse Comitatus Act (18 USC 1385) which prohibits federal military personnel from acting 
in a domestic law enforcement capacity unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or a sep
arate 
Act of Congress. When employed at home or abroad in Title 10 status, for all legal purposes, the forces 
become indistinguishable elements of the federal military force. In Title 10 status, National Guard 
soldiers were mobilized and deployed to augmen
t federal law enforcement agencies at the northern 
and southern borders of the contiguous U.S. in late spring and summer of 2002. Time consuming intra
- agency and inter
-agency negotiations and delays in approving Title 10 military responses are the norm.
 State
-to-State Assistance. 
During disaster response, if sufficient resources do not exist in State, the 
State has the option to request assistance from other States by using the Emergency Management 
Assistance Compact (EMAC).
 EMAC has been ratified by the U
.S. Congress and is law in all fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto 
Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. EMAC is activated when a Governor declares an Emergency or
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
20  Disaster and an event is opened in the online EMAC Operations System. State
-to-State requests are 
made between emergency management agencies and no other entities are authorized to act under or 
within EMAC. Deployment, completion of a mission, and demobilization occur only after the mission is 
authorized properly through EMAC. The 
process under which requesting States pay assisting States for 
their services is prescribed under EMAC law.
 State
-to-state assistance will not be requested until and unless local, State, volunteer, and private sector 
resources fall short of what will be re
quired to mount an effective response and/or recovery.
 In 2010, the five States in FEMA R6 
Œ Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico 
Œ entered 
into the Interstate Emergency Response Support Plan (IERSP). The member States will provide, through
 unified command, an immediate response and support capability to FEMA R6 States in a disaster or 
catastrophic event. The Plan will expedite the provision of assistance among the States in FEMA R6 and 
provide better visibility and acquisition of State reso
urces within the region. Requests for and provision 
of assistance under the IERSP will follow EMAC guidelines.
 Requesting Federal Assistance. 
When an incident overwhelms State resources and available mutual aid 
resources, the Governor may request federal a
ssistance. In such cases, the affected jurisdiction(s), the 
State and the federal government will collaborate to provide the necessary assistance.
   Demobilize
 Demobilization is the orderly, safe and efficient return of a resource to its original location 
and status. 
Demobilization should begin as soon as possible to facilitate accountability of the resources and be fully 
coordinated with other incident management and response structures.
 State Actions. 
At the State level, demobilization planning and activi
ties include:
  Steps to ensure personnel safety. 
  Provisions to track and verify the safe return of resources to their or
iginal locations. 
  Processes for tracking resources and ensuring applicable reimbursement. 
  Compliance with mutual aid provisions. 
  Inc
ident Management
   This section explains how the State is organized to achieve its incident response objectives.
 The National Incident Management System (NIMS) third edition was released in October 2017 by the
 U.S.
 Department of Homeland Security. NIMS provides
 a consistent nationwide incident management 
template to all levels of government, the private sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). It 
enables these stakeholders to work together to prevent, protect against, respond to, recover from, and 
mitiga
te the effects of incidents, regardless of cause, size, location, or
 complexity.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
21   State Response: Structures and Staffing
 State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC). 
The SEOC in North Little Rock is the physical location where 
State coordination occurs.
 The
 SEOC is activated as necessary to support local EOCs. State activities are coordinated from this 
central location. Decision makers and personnel supporting core functions report to the SEOC as 
required by the characteristics of each event. The primary fun
ction of the SEOC is to ensure that on 
scene responders have the resources (such as personnel, tools and equipment) they need.
 During a disaster or emergency, the SEOC informs the Governor and acts as liaison between local and 
federal personnel.
 The SEOC w
ill host the JIC as appropriate. The location of any JIC will be contingent on the features of 
the incident.
 Requesting and Managing Federal Assistance. 
The State hosts FEMA liaisons 
Œ which may be one 
person, an Incident Management Assistance Team (IMAT),
 and/or others 
Œ in the SEOC until response 
transitions to a Joint Field Office (JFO). SEOC staff works with the liaisons to reach and maintain a 
common operating picture and mount an effective response. SEOC staff is trained and tasked with 
generating the
 necessary documents to request federal resources and move them into affected areas as 
needed. The staff also coordinates communication between local and federal response elements and 
helps track and demobilize federal assets.
 State Coordinating Officer (S
CO). 
The SCO plays a critical role in managing the State response and 
recovery operations following Stafford Act declarations. The Governor appoints the SCO, and lines of 
authority flow from the Governor to the SCO, following the State™s policies and laws.
 The specific roles 
and responsibilities of the SCO include:
  Serve as the primary representative of the Governor to the Regional Response Coordination 
Center (RRCC) and in the
 JFO.
  Work with the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) to determine what the Stat
e requires, and 
set priorities for employment of federal resources provided to the
 State.
  Ensure coordination of all resources obtained from outside the
 State.
  Provide a link between the federal government and local
 government.
  Serve in the Unified Coordin
ation Group in the
 JFO.
 Governor™s Authorized Representative. 
The Governor has empowered a Governor™s Authorized 
Representative to:
  Execute
 all necessary
 documents
 for
 disaster
 assistance
 on
 behalf
 of
 the
 State,
 including 
certification of applications for 
public assistance and EMAC
 documents.
  Represent the Governor in the Unified Coordination Group, when
 required.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
22   Coordinate and supervise the State disaster assistance program to include serving as its 
grant
 administrator.
  Identify, in coordination with the
 SCO, the critical items of specific information required
 to 
support timely, logical
 decisions.
 Emergency Support Functions (ESF). 
The SEOC coordinates incident response support from across State 
government by calling up, as needed, one or more of the sixt
een ESFs. During a response, ESFs 
coordinate functional capabilities and resources provided by State departments and agencies, along 
with certain private sector and nonprofit organizations. They effectively bundle and funnel resources 
and capabilities to r
esponders. Each function is coordinated by a single agency, but will rely on several 
agencies that provide resources in support of that functional area. The mission of each ESF is to provide 
the most effective and efficient access to the resources held by 
State government regardless of which 
agency has those capabilities.
 The ESFs are the operational
-level mechanism to provide assistance in sixteen functional areas identified 
as necessary to effectively manage emergency and/or disaster.
 Each ESF is composed
 of coordinating, primary, and support agencies. The lead coordinating agency is 
the entity with management oversight for that particular ESF. The coordinator has ongoing 
responsibilities throughout the deployment, response, and recovery phases of incident
 management. 
Primary agencies are named on the basis of authorities, resources and capabilities for a particular 
function within an ESF. In the ARCEMP the same agency is often both coordinating and primary. Support 
agencies have specific resources and capa
bilities in a given functional area enabling support of a primary 
agency.
 Joint Field Office (JFO). 
The JFO is the primary incident management field structure. The JFO is a 
temporary facility that provides a central location for the coordination of federal
, State, and local 
governments; private sector businesses; and NGOs with primary responsibility for response and short
- term recovery. The JFO structure is organized, staffed, and managed in a manner consistent with NIMS 
principles and is led by the Unifie
d Coordination Group. The JFO does not manage on
-scene operations. 
It focuses on providing support to on
-scene efforts and to operations that extend beyond the incident 
site.
 Personnel from federal and State departments and agencies, other jurisdictional e
ntities and private 
sector businesses and NGOs may be requested to staff various levels of the JFO, depending on the 
requirements of the incident. The physical location of such a coordination entity depends on the 
situation.
  Basic Plan, Pg. 
23  Plan Development and Maintenan
ce
   The ARCEMP was originally written with input from each ESF Coordinating Agency and each Supporting 
Agency. Factors that could alter this plan are changes in the capabilities of a stakeholder, addition of a 
stakeholder who was not previously listed, im
provements in technology, lessons learned through real 
events, emergence of new threats, advice from subject matter experts, etc. These factors are analyzed 
in the same way that the plan is evaluated.
 The Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan is
 evaluated by exercise and by stakeholder 
review. Exercises are scheduled on the third Wednesday of each month. Entities with responsibilities 
under the plan are asked yearly to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the text that applies to 
them.
 Mater
ial revisions to the plan are made immediately. Revisions that have no immediate effect on the 
accuracy, feasibility, or completeness of the plan are made during the yearly evaluation. Changes are 
shown in the Record of Changes section of the ARCEMP and ar
e maintained as part of the plan for six 
years, by which time they have aged out of relevance.

the capability to disseminate, in a timely manner, official emergency public information. 
An effective public information
 program is instrumental in saving lives and limiting the 
loss of property. A Pubic Information Official (PIO) must be appointed to provide a single 
source of information to the media. Information thus must be non
-conflicting, and key 
officials will be fre
e to concentrate on the response. The PIO must have the capability to 
fully utilize the media to provide fast, accurate, official information and instructions to 
the public. A center should be designated where press conferences will be given and 
news relea

  Introduction
 The ESF #2 Communications annex provides guidance for rapid alerting and warning to key State 
and local jurisdictional officials and the general public of an impendin
g or occurring natural or 
technological emergency or disaster.  This annex also provides guidance for organizing, establishing, and 
maintaining the telecommunications and information system capabilities necessary to meet the 
operational requirements of sta
te and local jurisdictions in responding to and recovering from 
emergencies and disasters.
  Policies
 This annex will guide all State telecommunications, information systems, and warning activities 
related to prevention, protection, mitigation, response and
 recovery associated with emergencies or 
disasters.
 Telecommunications, information systems and warning support requirements which cannot be 
met at the local level will be escalated upward for resolution to the State level by contacting the 
Arkansas Divisi
on of Emergency Management (ADEM) and appropriate State agencies. If needed, ADEM 
will request federal assistance.
 Assumptions
 Reliable telecommunications and information system capabilities will be available at all levels of 
government for disaster commun
ications. The State will have communication capability from the 
primary or an alternate EOC.
    2021 ESF #2 Communications, Pg. 
56 Local jurisdiction emergency management organizations will continue to perform as primary 
warning points and non
-NAWAS relay warning points. They will maintain a 
continuing record of the 
status of the warning system and advise the local jurisdiction emergency management director of any 
deficiencies. They will also prepare, maintain, and exercise warning plans, SOPs, and call lists.
 Each local jurisdiction will test
 local jurisdiction procedures and warning systems and will 
respond to state tests of the warning network in accordance with the Statewide Warning Fan
-out.
 Local jurisdictions will determine methods of conveying warning to citizens and train all 
personnel 
staffing a warning point in the reception and dissemination of warning information.
  Concept of Operations
 General
 Emergency communications between local, state, and federal governments are provided 
through the Arkansas Response and Coordination Center (AR
CC). Day to day communications 
capabilities are robust and several layers of redundant systems exist.
  Communications and Warning Capabilities  
   An Emergency Alert System (EAS) terminal is located within the ARCC and EAS capability is 
available through th
e State Emergency Notification Software (SENS) that connects through 
the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS).
  Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) can be sent to user defined areas through IPAWS.
  HazCollect can send messages for non
-weather emerg
encies into the NOAA Weather Alert 
system, including NOAA Weather Radio (NWR), through IPAWS.
  State Emergency Notification Software (SENS) has the ability to send voice, text, and email 
notifications to ADEM Staff, Governor™s staff and cabinet, State Agenc
y Directors and 
successors, County Judges, and County Coordinators.    
  The ARCC is equipped with 5 Arkansas Wireless Information Network (AWIN) consoles.  All 
ADEM personnel are issued portable radio units.  A cache of portable and mobile units are

  Introduction
 Purpose
 The Purpose of the ESF #3
- Public Works and Engineering annex is to provide guidance for the 
evaluation, engineering services, and coordination of the following:  Structural inspection, emergency 
repair of water an
d wastewater treatment facilities, distribution of emergency potable water, debris 
removal, and emergency power support to predetermined facilities in situations requiring a State 
response. 
 Scope
 Activities appropriate to ESF #3 include the following:
  Par
ticipation in preparedness activities, such as pre
-positioning of equipment.  
  Participation in the needs/damage assessments during and following a public 
emergency. 
  Management of emergency debris removal and disposal from public property for 
lifesaving, 
property protection, and health and safety. 
  Coordination of emergency support for public health and safety, such as 
providing for debris removal, potable water, and power. 
  Technical assistance, including inspection of private residential structures and 
commercial structures involved in post
-disaster recovery, state owned and 
operated buildings, and public school facilities. 
  2021 ESF #
3 Public Works and Engineering
, Pg. 65  Provision of basic sanitation support such as street cleaning, litter can removal, 
fleet services, parking enforcement, and towing o
f illegally parked or abandoned 
vehicles. 
 Situation
  In some emergencies, damage to public works and engineering systems will be significant. 
Structures will be destroyed or weakened. Homes, public buildings, and other facilities will have to be 
reinforce
d or demolished to ensure safety. Utilities will be partially or fully inoperable. Debris will make 
streets and highways impassable. A public emergency will affect local response personnel and the 
facilities from which they operate. They will be unable to 
perform their emergency duties as they usually 
do. Equipment in the affected area will be damaged or inaccessible.
 Planning Assumptions
  Emergency debris clearance for access and emergency road repairs will be given 
top priority to support immediate lifesav
ing emergency response activities. 
  Preliminary damage assessments will be quick. Comprehensive follow
-up 
assessments will be performed as response transitions to recovery.
  The volume of debris and materials from demolition activities will require 
unconven
tional disposal strategies.
  All entities are responsible for complying with appropriate local, state, and 
federal environmental and historic preservation statutes. 
  Construction equipment, materials, and significant numbers of personnel having 
engineering 
and construction skills will be required from outside the disaster 
area.

75  Introduction
 The purpose of this annex is to prepare for those fire situations that are disastrous to the state™s 
natural resources, the economy, the public™s well
-bei
ng, and/or are beyond the capability of the agency 
and local resources. 
 Policies
  Priority is given to public/firefighter safety and property protection, in that order. 
  Personnel records are maintained permanently in Little Rock. 
  Fire reports and law enf
orcement records are maintained for a five
-year period at the Central 
Dispatch Center.
 Federal coordination with, and support of, state and local fire suppression organizations is 
expected to be accomplished through the State Forester, the Arkansas Divisio
n of Emergency 
Management , or other appropriate State agency operating under the National Incident Management 
System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS). There is a federal
-state agreement covering federal 
assistance in fighting forest and range fires.
 Concept of Operations
 General
 The Arkansas Department of Agriculture, Forestry Division is the primary agency designated to 
combat forest, range and rural fires on state and private lands.  It maintains district offices in seven (7) 
locations throughout the
 state and is an organization with communications, heavy equipment and 
aircraft dedicated to fire protection.
 ESF #4 manages and coordinates State firefighting activities. This function is accomplished by 
mobilizing firefighting resources in support of Sta
te and local wild land, rural, and urban firefighting 
agencies. ESF #4 uses established firefighting and support organizations, processes, and procedures 
outlined in the State Fire Mobilization Plan. Responsibility for situation assessment and determinatio
n of 
local resource needs lies primarily with the District Forester. 
 For resources beyond those available within the state, requests are sent to the South Central 
Compact Coordinator located in the Southern Area Coordination Center (SACC), in Atlanta, GA,
 by the 
State Forester or his/her designee to activate the South Central Compact. 
  2021 ESF #4 Firefighting, Pg. 
76  Resolution of shortages may also be pursued by the Arkansas Division of Emergency 
Management (ADEM). Actual firefighting operations are managed under the ICS. Situation and 
damage 
assessment information is transmitted according to NIMS procedures.
 Organization
 In the event that the State Forester is unable to perform his/her duties, the following is the line 
of succession for the Arkansas Department of Agriculture 
- Forestry 
Division:
 1. Deputy State Forester
 2. Emergency Services Director/Assistant State Forester 
- Protection
 3. Division Forester (The Division Forester with the most years of service within the division)
 Actions
 Pre
-Incident
  Prevention. 
Education is the most favorable
 method of fire prevention.  The Arkansas 
Department of Agriculture cooperates with the Arkansas Fire Prevention Commission, the Cooperative 
Extension Service, State Fire Marshall, and local groups in many educational prevention activities.  
 The Arkansas 
Department of Agriculture limits its engineering methods of fire prevention to 
hazard reduction burns and custom fire lane construction.  Upon request, Foresters or Rangers will 
provide advice to rural homeowners about making the property more fire safe.
  Law Enforcement is the third method of fire prevention employed by the Arkansas Department 
of Agriculture.  The Department of Agriculture has full time forest investigators and district law 
enforcement officers to enforce the fire laws and combat woods ars
on. 
 Preparedness
. The Arkansas Department of Agriculture conducts an extensive fire
-training 
program for its Forestry Division employees and others who support the efforts of the Department of 
Agriculture.  Foresters and rangers are given progressive trai
ning in the techniques and science of fire 
control as they advance through their careers.  Regional and national training is provided through 
cooperation with sister states and the U.S. Forest Service.  The Arkansas Department of Agriculture 
conducts train
ing in ground cover fire suppression for volunteer fire departments and forest industries 
upon request.  Basic first aid training is also provided to fire suppression personnel.
  2021 ESF #4 Firefighting, Pg. 
77  The Arkansas Department of Agriculture cooperates with the National Weather Se
rvice and the 
U.S. Forest Service in the daily monitoring of weather conditions.  The Arkansas Department of 
Agriculture has permanent weather stations located at sites throughout the state for purposes of 
observing and collecting fire weather data.  The N
ational Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) is used to 
rate fire conditions from day
-to-day and area
-to-area.  This system provides the fire staff with 
information to make decisions about the risk of fire occurrence and severity.  Current and forecast wind 
conditions are used to determine if they would support large and intense fires.
   Expected fire danger and smoke management information is broadcast each morning on 
NOAA weather radio.
  The SEOC will be notified by the Arkansas Department of Agriculture when 
very high and/or 
extreme conditions are forecast.
  Warnings will be disseminated by the Arkansas Department of Agriculture communications 
system to the public and corroborators. 
 The Arkansas Department of Agriculture uses two primary means of fire detectio
n 
Œ aerial and 
public telephone 
Œ in its daily operations.  Communications equipment is tested regularly to ensure that 
dispatching and reporting systems are working properly.  Aircraft are assigned to every area of the state.  
First priority use of aircra
ft is for fire detection.  The frequencies of detection flights are determined by 
forecast and current weather conditions, historic and present fire occurrence and public activity.  Each 
area of the state has access to an Arkansas Department of Agriculture
 dispatcher or employee by public 
telephone for reporting fires or other emergencies.
  Contingency plans and emergency duty assignments have been developed and are maintained 
for replacing or compensating for loss of personnel and/or emergency equipment an
d supplies in the 
event of an earthquake or other catastrophic incident. Each county coordinator will have a list of 
available resources upon request.

 Introduction
 Policy. 
The ADEM Director (acting as 
the Governor™s Authorized Representative) will take all 
necessary actions to reduce the loss of life and property, diminish harm to the environment, and meet 
basic human needs in a situation requiring a state response. 
The ESF #5 Coordinating Agency will
 prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against the effects of disasters and will work to 
restore and preserve the social, economic, and political structure of all affected local jurisdictions.
 Concept of Operations
 General. 
The normal organizat
ional structure of state government, following National Incident 
Management System (NIMS) guidelines, will be maintained in response to disasters. ADEM Duty Officers 
will resolve most emergencies with assistance from partner agencies, organizations, and pe
rsonnel.
 The Multi
-Agency Coordination (MAC) Group consists of the Governor™s Cabinet Members 
and/or Designees. The MAC Group will congregate with the Governor. The group will establish strategic 
objectives to affect the disaster/emergency. The State Emerg
ency Operations Center (SEOC) and 
coordinating departments/agencies will support the MAC Group and its objectives. The SEOC will 
increase activation level at the recommendation of the Response and Recovery Division Director or the 
Operations Branch Manager
.  2021 ESF #5 Emergency Management, Pg. 
84  The Team Chief may ask specific ESFs to staff the SEOC. ESF Lead Coordinating Agency 
representatives will report to the SEOC. ESF #5 will coordinate the support offered by these agencies. 
 ESF #5 provides staffing to fill management positions in the Comm
and, Operations, Planning, 
Logistics, and Finance and Administration Sections of the SEOC and Joint Field Office (JFO) as needed. 
ESF #5 will coordinate operations and situational reporting to the Governor and other government 
agencies.
 SEOC staff will mon
itor potential or developing incidents and support the preparation, response, 
recovery, and mitigation efforts of field operations. 
 Organizational Structure
 In most disasters, affected local governments will provide adequate direction and control. When 
local governments cannot perform these functions, they may ask State government to temporarily 
assume direction and control. Direction and control support may come from other local EOCs or state 
agencies.
 ESF #5 organizational structure is consistent with th
e command and general staff functions 
described in the NIMS. These functions are operations, planning, logistics, and finance/administration.
 Operations.
 The SEOC coordinates State level emergency operations. As the ESF Lead 
Coordinating Agency for emergen
cy management, ADEM ensures Duty Officers staff the SEOC to 
support 24
-hour operations. ADEM develops and maintains notification procedures and contact 
information to respond to incidents in Arkansas. The SEOC will notify all stakeholders of threats or 
inc
idents in accordance with Emergency Operations Checklists, which have been developed for each 
hazard. The SEOC operational procedures are in the 2018 Arkansas State EOC Plan and SEOC Standard 
Operating Guidelines.
 Planning. 
ADEM staffs the Planning Section
 in the SEOC. The Planning Section offers situational 
awareness regarding incident status and response actions by creating and updating the State Situation 
Report. The Planning Section creates the State Plan of Action (POA). This plan will document inciden
t priorities as set by the SEOC Leadership Group, establish the operational period and tempo, and develop 
staffing plans related to the incident. The Geographic Information System (GIS) position within the 
Planning Section maps impacted counties, road clos
ures, etc. to develop a Common Operating Picture 
 2021 ESF #5 Emergency Management, Pg. 
85  (COP) and may be staffed by supporting agencies such as the Arkansas GIS Office. The Planning Section 
also enlists subject matter expert support for tasks that require specific technical knowledge. 
 Logistic
s. ADEM personnel staff the SEOC Logistics Section. The Logistics Section will control and 
account for supplies and equipment, locate resources, and organize delivery of equipment, supplies, and 
services. The Logistics Section will also track resources req
uested by local jurisdictions and state 
agencies. The Logistics Section coordinates closely with all ESFs to carry out this function. 
 Finance/Administration
. ADEM personnel staff the Finance and Administration Section to 
monitor funding and expenses. The 
Finance and Administration Section is responsible for ADEM 
employee services, including personnel, facilities, and assets. The Finance and Administration Section 
documents all costs associated with an incident. The Director of ADEM will administer the Gove
rnor™s 
Disaster Fund and arrange for federal aid through FEMA, as needed. 
 Support Agencies.
 All support agencies have named liaisons or points of contact to provide 
technical and subject matter expertise, data, advice, and support for operations that fall
 within the 
domain of each agency. 
 Actions
 State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC). 
When there is a credible threat, the Response and 
Recovery Division Director may increase the current activation level, deploy an Area Coordinator to the 
threat location,
 and/or take other necessary actions. The ARCC will notify key stakeholders of a change 
in activation levels. The staffing level of the SEOC will increase with the activation level, based on need. 
SEOC staff will provide situation reports to the Governor™s
 Office and FEMA Region 6 and other agencies, 
per the State EOC Plan and SEOC Standard Operating Guidelines during periods of increased activation.
 ESF #5 will coordinate operations within the SEOC throughout the incident, will maintain 
communications with
 affected jurisdictions, and will conduct periodic briefings to coordinate joint local, 
state, and federal operations. ESF #5 will coordinate the activation of other ESFs as appropriate and 
establish reporting and communications protocols for all activated
 functions.
 Incident Planning and Management Activities:
 ESF #5 supports situational awareness of incidents, in coordination with government agencies, 
private sector, and volunteer organizations. It represents the State™s interests in coordination of the 
 2021 ESF #5 Emergency Management, Pg. 
86  Federal
-State operational partnership. ESF #5 ensures that local governments and individual assistance 
applicants receive timely, equitable, and comprehensive assistance as per State statutes and directives.
 As the operation progresses from the pre
-incident
 phase through response and into recovery, 
ESF #5 continues to offer immediate, short
-term, and long
-term planning functions in coordination with 
the other ESFs engaged in the operation. As the local jurisdiction assumes greater responsibility for the 
reco
very operation, ESF #5 coordinates the responsible and orderly termination of State assistance.

Emergency Support Function #6 
- Mass Care, Emergency Assistance, Housing, 
and Human Services Annex to the Arkansas Com
prehensive Emergency 
Management Plan
  Information provided by the Arkansas Division of Workforce Services
  The purpose of the ﬁRobert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Actﬂ (42 U.S.C. 
5177 and 20 CFR Part 625) more commonly referred to a
s the Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) 
program is to provide payment and reemployment assistance to individuals who are unemployed as a 
direct result of a major disaster and are not otherwise eligible to receive regular unemployment 
insurance benefit
s. Individuals, including self
-employed individuals, who were living or working in the 
affected areas at the time of the major disaster, and who are unemployed as a result of the major 
disaster, may be eligible for DUA during the Disaster Assistance Period
. Funding becomes available to 
administer the program and pay potentially eligible individuals through the Department of Labor 
Regional Office in Dallas, Texas but is administered by the Department of Workforce Services (DWS).  
Funding for DUA is provided 
by FEMA and does not come from employer payroll taxes, which funds 
regular unemployment insurance programs.  
 A major disaster would include hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, major fires and can 
include man
-made disasters. Department of Workforce
 Services (DWS) local office personnel frequently 
gather information in the immediate aftermath of a disaster to provide preliminary damage assessments 
of businesses in the counties they serve.  The information provided by local office personnel include 
pr
ojected numbers of businesses affected, the types of businesses affected, the extent of damage and 
commuting patterns of the workforce.  
 To qualify for a Major Disaster Declaration, the damage sustained from the major disaster must 
clearly be more than st
ate or local governments can handle without federal assistance.  A Major Disaster 
Declaration normally takes the followings steps:  the local government responds to the disaster, the 
state responds to the disaster, a damage assessment is made by local, sta
te and federal agencies, the 
Governor requests a Major Disaster Declaration that includes the types of assistance being sought, 
FEMA evaluates the request and recommends action to the President, the President approves or denies 
 2021 ESF #6 Mass Care, Pg. 
100
  the request.  DUA will not t
rigger unless an area is declared by the President to be a major disaster area 
and
 Individual Assistance is authorized under the Major Disaster Declaration.  
 If a Major Disaster Declaration authorizes Individual Assistance, DWS promptly notifies the 
publi
c of the availability of DUA, who may file for DUA, the filing period for DUA claims, where DUA 
claims may be filed, what documentation is needed to support the application for DUA and identifies the 
disaster assistance period.   The local offices are also
 notified of the availability to DUA and steps are 
taken to ensure that each local office in the affected areas have all of the required forms needed for an 
individual to initiate the DUA application process.
 DWS local offices typically begin accepting cla
ims for DUA the day following the issuance of the 
News Release notifying the public of the availability of DUA.  DWS also establishes temporary locations 
in areas most impacted by the major disaster.   
 Individuals applying for DUA benefits must provide pr
oof of employment, self
-employment or 
prospective employment and income information for the most recently completed tax year within 21 
days of applying for DUA benefits.  Due to this deadline, each local office mails DUA applications by 
overnight mail or f
axes DUA claims to the Central Office each day.  Once a DUA application is received by 
the Central Office, a determination is made on the applicant™s eligibility for DUA, the amount of 
assistance that will be provided, subject to deductions of income from 
work or self
-employment, and 
what additional documentation must be supplied from the applicant.  If an applicant is determined to be 
eligible for DUA, the individual may be entitled to DUA benefits for each week claimed during the 
disaster assistance perio
d. The initial release of DUA benefits to affected individuals will depend when 
funds are obligated to DWS by FEMA and the United States Department of Labor.  All Weekly Assistance 
checks are mailed from the Central Office to the affected individual until 
such time as the individual 
becomes re
-employed or resumes self
-employment. 
 Currently, the DUA application process, submission of weekly claims, adjudication process and 
payments are not automated processes.  As a result, DUA applications, adjudications a
nd payments can 
be made from any DWS office or temporary facility in the state in the event of a loss or temporary 
closure of a DWS local office or Central Office. Implementation of the DUA process assumes that the 
operations of the Arkansas Division of Wo
rkforce Services (DWS) and the Arkansas Division of 
Information Systems (DIS) have not been adversely affected by the disaster or that their operations have 
been successfully recovered or restored.

 Introduction
 ESF #7 is responsible for planning and performing prospective functions during an emergency 
when State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) activation is necessary. ESF 
#7 provides support to 
emergency response and recovery efforts during the initial response phase and initial recovery phase 
following a disaster. ESF #7 offers guidance, management, and procurement of resources in an 
emergency. ESF #7 locates, procures, an
d issues resources. If necessary ESF #7 procures transportation 
of resources to staging areas or affected areas. Some of the resources ESF #7 might be asked to provide 
are food, water, supplies, office space, office equipment, fuel (with limitations), cont
racting services, 
small & heavy equipment, etc.
  2021 ESF #7 Resource Support, Pg. 
102
 Purpose and Scope
 ESF #7 provides management and procurement of resources in an emergency. The priorities for 
allocation of these assets are as follows:
  Provide supplies and equipment from current state stock
s or surplus and, if necessary, from 
commercial sources. Each state agency is responsible for its own resource requirements.
  Support agencies will furnish resources in support of ESF requirements as needed.
  Current state and federal laws and regulations, w
hich include emergency procedures, will 
guide procurement of resources.
 Concept of Operations
 This section discusses general goals and operational resource management activities. 
 Goals
  Locate and/or procure essential resources to support emergency operati
ons.
  Facilitate the procurement of food and other essential resources.
  Assist with procurement of supplies for mass care facilities and medical facilities.
 Assumptions
  The Governor™s Office will forward a copy of the Executive Order or Disaster Proclamatio
n to 
the Department of Finance and Administration (DFA).
  The primary source of equipment, supplies, and personnel will be support agencies™ 
resources and local sources outside the impacted area. When these sources cannot provide 
support, ESF #7 will coordi
nate with commercial sources to procure resources if possible.
  ESF # 7 will be asked to procure resources after all other sources have been exhausted.
  Procurement activities will maintain the free market economy and existing systems to the 
maximum extent p
ossible.
  The public will be encouraged to cooperate with any emergency measures.
  Agents may obtain resources from suppliers not listed in the support sources.
  Volunteer companies, organizations and groups are willing to assist the community during a 
disast
er. Local government/county officials will manage volunteers and donations. 
  2021 ESF #7 Resource Support, Pg. 
103
 General
 When the SEOC raises the activation level, the Arkansas Department of Finance and 
Administration (DFA) will perform the following in the order listed.
  Develop situational 
awareness by reviewing, identifying and evaluating reports, video, 
message traffic, status boards, and logs. 
  Report to the SEOC.
  Maintain situational analysis and awareness throughout the response and short
-term 
recovery phase to include: 
 o A general descr
iption of the situation as it pertains to ESF #7 and the ESF™s operational 
support requirements.
 o A prioritized listing of significant actions that ESF #7 will initiate to provide operational 
support.
 o Determine the necessary response level required from ESF
 #7.
 o Initiate notification of the required personnel and support organizations to achieve the 
required level of response.
 o Based upon the situation analysis, prepare a list of ESF #7™s objective
-based priority 
actions to support lifesaving and short
-term re
covery operations. Revise the action list 
as the situation changes.
 o Aid in the mobilization of resources and coordinate response for approved mission 
assignments as needed.
 o Prepare briefings on status of ESF #7 response operations.
 o Keep track of all expend
itures in support of emergency operations and submit these to 
ESF #5 upon request.
 o Prepare an ESF #7 After
-Action Report to identify lessons learned and make 
improvements where needed. Ideally this will be captured in WebEOC.
    2021 ESF #7 Resource Support, Pg. 
104
 Organization
 ESF #7 will wor
k in coordination with ESF #5 and the Arkansas Division of Emergency 
Management. ESF #7 will remain active throughout the emergency until released by ESF #5.
 The ESF # 7 Emergency Coordinator will coordinate with at least two members of the Federal 
Advance
 Team (Federal ESF #7, General Services Administration procurement officials) at the SEOC 
during a federally declared disaster.
 The SEOC Team Chief will determine the need to report to the SEOC based on the circumstances 
of each declared emergency. DFA rep
resentatives offer services more readily available in DFA offices 
and can respond more rapidly to state needs in emergency situations. If total communication failure 
occurs, DFA will send a trained liaison to represent DFA in the SEOC. 
 Notification
 The St
ate Warning Point or ESF #5 will notify the ESF #7 Emergency Coordinator, who will 
determine what agencies need to support ESF #7 operations. ESF #7 will obtain inventories of resources 
including government buildings and public facilities as necessary. 
 Response Actions
 During disaster response, ESF # 7 will find and procure resources as requested by ESF #5. If 
resources cannot be located or purchased, ESF #7 will pass the request to the SEOC Liaison Officer.
 ESF # 7 has purchasing restrictions on certain i
tems such as aviation fuel. ESF #7 will not acquire 
restricted items.
 Initial Actions
  Stage resources near the emergency areas, if possible.
  Request support agencies deploy personnel and other resources as needed.
  Assess resources, including facilities, av
ailable for emergency support.
 Continuous Actions
 ESF #7 will coordinate the following actions throughout the emergency/incident:
  The Arkansas Division of Building Authority will handle lease negotiations for buildings, 
staging warehouses, and the replacem
ent of damaged or destroyed facilities.
  2021 ESF #7 Resource Support, Pg. 
105
  DFA will procure office furniture, equipment, and supplies that existing inventories cannot 
provide.
 ESF #7 will coordinate contractual services between state and commercial sources.

designated ADH personnel to staff the State EOC, staff the ADH EOC, and the Joint Information Center 
(JIC), as required.  Personnel representing an ESF #8 supporting agency will have extensive knowledge of 
the resources and capabilities of their res
pective organizations and will have access to the appropriate 
authority for committing such resources during the activation. 
  Once activated, ESF #8 will coordinate with the appropriate state, local and federal medical and 
public health officials and orga
nizations to determine current medical and public health assistance 
requirements. During the response period, ESF #8 has primary responsibility for the evaluation and 
analysis of public health and medical assistance.  ESF#8 also develops and updates assess
ments of 
medical and public health status.
  Local emergency service organizations and medical care providers that are still functional after a 
disaster or major emergency may need assistance and/or guidance from ESF #8 concerning how best to 
  2021 ESF #8 Public Health and Medical Services, Pg.

  Support agencies are responsible for maintaining documentation to support requests for 
reimbursement; submitting final reimburseme
nt requests within the terms of the mission assignment or 
reimbursable agreement; and notifying requesting agencies when a task is completed and/or when 
additional time is required to complete work in advance of the projected completion date.
 Federal Respo
nse
  The state brings in federal assistance when an event occurs for which local, state, and volunteer 
resources are inadequate to fulfill the required response.
 Medical Care & EMS Support
  The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is a federally coordin
ated initiative to augment 
the national emergency medical response capability. The Little Rock Metropolitan Area NDMS 
Operations Center is located at the VA Medical Cent
er, North Little Rock Division. 
The overall purpose of 
the NDMS is to establish a singl
e national medical response capability for:
  Assisting state and local authorities in dealing with the medical and health effects of 
major peacetime disasters; and
  Providing support to the military and VA medical systems in caring for casualties 
evacuated b
ack to the United States from foreign, armed conflicts.
 Health Protection Support
  In a situation that exceeds the capability of ADH resources for monitoring, assessment, and/or 
disease control activities, assistance may be required from certain federal ag
encies. ADH is the 
appropriate liaison agency in such a situation, and may directly request assistance from The U.S. 
Department of Health & Human Services, Public Health Service (DHHS, PHS) which includes:
  The Food & Drug Administration (FDA), and
  The Cent
ers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).
  The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR)
 In the event an emerging health threat develops, 
the World Health Organization (WHO) will 
notify the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) a
nd other national health agencies 
on the progress.  CDC will communicate with ADH and other stakeholders about the status, 
specific information about the emerging threat, countermeasure to include availability, national 
response coordination, and other rec
ommended strategies for detection, control and response. 
ADH works to provide this information to partners and citizens alike.

 INTRODUCTION
  Policy
 The State's assistance under this function shall include personnel and equipment resources for 
the co
ordination and implementation of the following 
  Search 
- All activities associated with the discovery of an individual or individuals missing or 
reported missing.
  Rescue 
- All activities requiring trained personnel directed towards extrication of persons 
trapped in damaged buildings, vehicles, woodlands and waterways; and to provision of 
emergency medical treatment to such persons.
  Situation assessment and determination of resource needs 
Œ Personnel involved in search 
and rescue will convey their first
-pers
on perceptions to local incident commanders who are 
coordinating with the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC).
  Assumptions
  A major disaster or civil emergency, such as an earthquake or other man
-made or natural 
disaster, may result in conditions tha
t vary widely in scope, urgency and degree of devastation.  
Substantial numbers of people could be in life threatening situations requiring prompt rescue and 
medical care.  Because the mortality rate for missing or trapped victims will dramatically increas
e after 
72 hours, search and rescue (SAR) efforts must begin immediately. As an event progresses, a situation 
can deteriorate and may threaten both survivors and rescue personnel alike.  
      2021 ESF #9 Search and Rescue, Pg. 
115
 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
 General
 ESF #9 performs search and rescue an
d coordinates the use of resources from outside the ESF

rescue organizations, processes and procedures. 
 The wildlife officer in charge shall follow the gui
delines as set forth in Arkansas Game and Fish 
Commission Policies with the exception being drowning victim searches. All drowning victim searches 
and diving missions shall be conducted in accordance with the responding agencies™ policies.
 When solicited, 
volunteers are utilized for search and rescue operations, the wildlife officer in 
charge shall follow the guidelines as written in the state policy order regarding workmen's 
compensation benefits procedures.
 Organization
 Arkansas Game and Fish Commission i
s the coordinating agency for this ESF with support from 
other state and local agencies and volunteer organizations.  The staffing pattern and level will be 
dependent upon the severity of the emergency.

 INTRODUCTION
 Purpose
 The purpose of
 this ESF is to provide state
-coordinated support to local governments in response to an 
actual or potential discharge or uncontrolled release of oil or hazardous materials. Situations may 
include transportation incidents, fixed facility incidents, natural
 disasters, or intentional/terrorist acts 
that pose a threat to human health, property, or the environment.  
 For the purposes of this plan, ﬁhazardous materialsﬂ is a general term intended to mean hazardous 
substances, pollutants, and contaminants to incl
ude biological, radiological, and explosive substances.  
ESF #10 may respond to actual or potential incidents involving materials not typically considered 
hazardous but posing a threat to human health, property, or the environment.  As an element of the 
Ar
kansas Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (ARCEMP), ESF #10 defines the State™s response 
to these situations.
 Scope
 ESF #10 provides for an effective and efficient response to discharges of oil or hazardous materials by 
coordinating human, financial, 
and material resources in support of the impacted jurisdiction. This ESF 
establishes lead coordination roles for division and specification of responsibilities among state agencies 
that may be needed in response actions. ESF #10 does not place any state ag
ency or its representatives 
in the position of Incident Commander (IC) unless there are not local resources available to provide 
command and control of the incident and only in coordination and at the direction of the Secretary (or 
designee) of the Arkansa
s Department of Energy and Environment (E&E). Department representatives 
respond in advisory, guidance, and coordination roles.
 Interface with Federal Regional Response Team
 This ESF does not impede or negate the use of or request for the activation of the
 Federal Regional 
Response Team (RRT). The RRT is made up of regional representatives of the federal and state agencies 
within the region and is co
-chaired by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the 
United States Coast Guard (USCG).
 The RRT serves as a planning and preparedness body before a 
response, organizing these agencies™ response resources and providing coordination and advice to the 
Federal On
-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) during response actions. The RRT participates in preparedn
ess 
activities under this ESF and is expected to be closely involved in response activities if this ESF is 
activated.
 At the state level, activities under ESF #10 provide a bridge between the local Incident Commander, 
State On
-Scene Coordinator (SOSC), and
 RRT support related to the overall incident response activities. 
The SOSCs will carry out their responsibilities under the ARCEMP to coordinate, integrate, and manage 
the state effort to contain, identify, cleanup, dispose of, or minimize releases of oil 
or hazardous 
substances; or prevent, mitigate, or minimize the threat of potential releases. These efforts will be 
coordinated through the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC).

 Relationship to other ESFs
 Some incidents may require simultaneous activati
on of ESF #10 with other ESFs that describe additional 
procedures. This would include ESF #8 for biological and radiological/nuclear incidents that are not 
addressed in ESF #10.
 The E&E Division of Environmental Quality (DEQ) may solicit support from the f
ollowing agencies. DEQ 
will inform ADEM when responding to ESF #10 incidents without direct involvement of the SEOC:
  ESF #3 (Public Works and Engineering
ŒARDOT): Engineering services, assessment of and 
emergency repairs to wastewater treatment facilities, 
debris clearance for access to 
releases, release containment, securing of orphan containers, chemical analysis.
  ESF #5 (Emergency Management
ŒADEM): Send Situation Reports (SITREPS), electronic 
briefings convey and coordinate mission assignments, receive co
nsolidated SITREPS. 
  ESF #8 (Public Health and Medical Services

 SITUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS
 Situations
  Large quantities of oil and hazardous materials are transported via
 highway, rail, air, 
pipeline, and waterway on a daily basis creating a high probability of an incident/release.
  Hazardous materials are manufactured, stored, distributed, utilized, and disposed of at 
numerous fixed facilities located throughout the state.
 Hazardous chemicals may be used as causative agents or become a byproduct contained within 
debris during an intentional/terrorist event.
 Planning Assumptions
 The following planning assumptions have been made.
  All participating agencies/departments will op
erate under the National Incident 
Management System (NIMS).
  Actual or potential releases of oil or hazardous materials may occur on a daily basis, either 
by accident or as the result of an intentional/terrorist act.
  An 
oil or hazardous materials incident 
may progress to a point where it becomes
 a serious 
threat to human health and safety and to the environment.
  Multiple oil or hazardous materials incidents 
may 
occur simultaneously on land or in waters 
following a major disaster such as a flood, earthquake, 
tornado, or terrorist attack.
  Local response agencies will be overwhelmed by the extent of the response effort required 
to assess, mitigate, monitor, cleanup, and dispose of oil or hazardous materials releases.
  Response personnel, cleanup crews, and respon
se equipment may have difficulty reaching 
the site of an oil or hazardous materials release because of the damage sustained by the 
transportation infrastructure.
  Additional response and cleanup personnel and equipment will be needed to supplement 
existing 
capabilities and to provide backup or relief resources.
  Concern about facilities located in or near the affected area even if a natural or other 
catastrophic disaster does not cause situations where there are actual releases.
  Laboratories utilized for anal
yzing hazardous materials samples may be damaged, 
destroyed, or unable to meet the demand volume.
  Facilities that store or use oil or hazardous materials may be damaged or destroyed.
  Petroleum refineries and storage facilities may be damaged or destroyed.
  Petroleum retailers may sustain damage and require assistance.
  Pipelines may rupture.
   2021 E
SF #10 Oil and Hazardous Materials Response, Pg. 
125
  Degradation of tanks, drums, or holding ponds can occur and spill control apparatus and 
containment measures may not be effective at fixed facilities (e.g., chemical plan
ts, tank 
farms, laboratories, hazardous waste sites) which produce, generate, use, store, or dispose 
of oil or hazardous materials.
  Exceptions to current disposal practices and emissions will be necessary during major 
disasters.
  Disposal of waste material,
 soil, and other material will be at a permitted site and handled 
by private contractor, when possible, with the responsible party being liable for associated 
costs of the response, remediation of the affected area, and disposal.
  There may be potential rel
eases of materials not typically considered hazardous but which 
pose a threat to human health, property, or the environment.
 Support Assumptions
  County and municipal governments are responsible for the safety of persons and property in 
their jurisdictions.
  Response forces at the local level are the initial responders.
  Hazardous materials response teams or other qualified local response personnel will 
determine the need for a State response and notify the County Office of Emergency 
Management Coordinator or 
ADEM.
  Full cooperation of local governments and volunteer agencies to cope with an incident or 
disaster will occur.
  All local entities have up
-to-date emergency response plans addressing oil and hazardous 
materials releases and have a means for initial res
ponse and in many cases, complete 
response to these types of incidents.
     2021 E
SF #10 Oil and Hazardous Materials Response, Pg. 
126
 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
 General
 Working with local and state entities, ESF #10 coordinates the provision of support to and management 
of various responses to ensure actions are taken t
o mitigate, clean up, and dispose of oil and hazardous 
materials and minimize impact of the incidents.  
 In the event of an actual or potential release of oil, hazardous materials, or other materials that pose a 
threat to human health, property, or the env
ironment, ESF #10, or portions of it, may be implemented. 
This ESF addresses the emergency phase of the state response and will direct the efforts to supplement 
the local emergency response actions immediately following a major incident or disaster. Federa
l, state, 
and local officials must maintain close coordination. ESF #10 operations will contain, identify, cleanup, 
remove, dispose of, or minimize releases of or prevent, mitigate, or minimize the threat of potential 
releases of oil or hazardous substance
s (see support functions). All responding agencies will respond in 
support of the local Incident Commander.
 As the Primary ESF #10 agency, the E&E Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC)/SOSC will coordinate 
communication and responses with other appropriate 
agencies, local government, and responsible 
parties as necessary. The ERC/SOSC is responsible for assessing the level of DEQ™s response and 
coordinating the agency's response activities. The notifications of oil or hazardous materials releases 
and threshol
d planning quantities are made through the SEOC and properly relayed to DEQ. For 
intentional or terrorist events, the FBI and DEQ will closely coordinate to facilitate management of the 
release and investigation.
 Direction and control of the DEQ response d
epends upon the needs created by the situation. In 
accordance with the assignment of responsibilities in this ESF, support agencies will provide resources 
and support in response to a release or threat of release of oil or hazardous materials.
 When, due to
 multiple response actions, more than one SOSC is involved in implementing a response, 
the ESF will be the mechanism through which close coordination will be maintained among all agencies 
and SOSCs. The lead agency for this ESF will ensure that response ac
tions are properly coordinated and 
carried out.
 DEQ is responsible for providing logistical support to its personnel and for tracking and maintaining 
equipment and supplies. DEQ has developed and will maintain points of contact for resources from 
agency co
ntractors and vendors that are necessary to carry out their responsibilities.
 Direction and Control
 In responding to oil or hazardous materials incidents, DEQ™s priorities are to accurately assess the 
situation and then recommend appropriate prevention, co
ntainment, and abatement measures.  
Specific actions may include stabilizing the release through the use of berms, dikes, or impoundments; 
capping of contaminated soils or sludge; use of chemicals and other materials to contain or retard the 
spread of the 
release or to decontaminate or mitigate its effects; drainage controls; fences, warning 
signs, or other security or site
-control precautions; removal of highly contaminated soils from drainage 
areas; removal of drums, barrels, tanks, or other containers th
at contain oil or hazardous materials; and 
other measures as deemed necessary. For actual or potential releases of materials not typically

activities may i
nclude, but are not limited to, water quality monitoring and protection; air quality 
sampling and monitoring; household and business hazardous waste collection; and the permitting and 
monitoring of debris collection and disposal related to the clean
-up and
 recovery. 
In emergency 
situations DEQ has limited funds to contract for containment and abatement measures.
 The Arkansas Wireless Information Network (AWIN) is the Department's primary means of coordination 
during response incidents. Telephones, computers
, fax, cell phones, and messengers can be used widely 
for communication with other agencies, local governments, and responsible parties in most cases. Large 
incidents requiring federal government intervention may be communicated to the RRT via the SEOC and
 or computer communications.
 When requested or upon SEOC activation, a DEQ representative will report to the SEOC as needed or as 
resources allow.
 The ESF #10 Coordinator will determine the support agencies to be notified and complete notification of 
these
 agencies. Representatives of other agencies supporting ESF #10 may also be requested to report 
to the SEOC.
 DEQ and the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) maintain a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
for hazardous materials emergency response addressing 
the coordination of response efforts between 
the two agencies. The MOU outlines DEQ™s responsibility to coordinate the containment, remediation, 
and monitoring of releases; and ADH responsibilities for essential medical care and health protection 
from rele
ases. Additionally, DEQ and ADEM maintain a MOU regarding coordination and SEOC support. 
These agreements are on file at each agency.

 Introduction
 Policies
 Actions under ESF #11 are coordinated with and conducted cooperatively with federal, state, 
and local management officials and with pri
vate entities as needed. Each supporting agency is 
responsible for managing its respective assets and resources after receiving direction from the primary 
agency for the incident.
 Animal depopulation activities are conducted as humanely and sparingly as po
ssible while 
stopping pathogen spread. Disposal methods are chosen for effectiveness and minimal impact on the 
environment.
 Assumptions
 There is a potential for the farming community, State, or local officials to receive threats to 
agriculture as a mechani
sm for terrorism. If a negative impact to agriculture is recognized anywhere in 
the United States, the entire agricultural community in the country is potentially affected. Awareness of 
such an agricultural event elsewhere will prompt Arkansas to employ ad
ditional preparedness measures 
to prevent or mitigate the possibility of a similar occurrence in the state. Numerous local, state, and 
federal agencies will play a role in containing the contamination, eradicating the disease, or otherwise 
minimizing the i
mpact of the situation. Response efforts will depend on the agent causing the 
emergency and the mechanism chosen to control it. The response could encompass culling or 
quarantining potentially infected plants or animals, expansive treatment programs, preem
ptive crop 
destruction or culling of uninfected neighboring livestock and/or wildlife, restricting movement of 
  2021 ESF #11 Agriculture and Natural Resources, Pg. 
149
  animals, equipment, vehicles, pets, people, or other materials and/or other mitigating measures. Vector 
control may be necessary to mitigate move
ment/spread of the agent. It will likely include the discarding 
or containment of any contaminated matter, organic or inorganic, related to the event by proximity, 
similar appearance, or in any other way. Vector control may include rodent, bird, and insect
 control.
  Eradication will require proper sanitary and disposal procedures for contaminated plant 
material and animal carcasses.
  Suspected infected locations and transport vehicles will be cleaned and disinfected.
  An agricultural incident will require fede
ral involvement and activation of ESF #11 of the 
National Response Framework.
  The perimeter of the response will depend on the disease in question and epidemiological 
risk factors. Response procedures will extend across State lines and require a coordinate
d 
national and international response as the impact on agriculture and commerce may be felt 
internationally. 
  If the agricultural incident includes a threat to humans, the Arkansas Department of Health 
(ADH) will assist in the response effort. Health advis
ories will be published to inform the 
public of the risk and protective actions. 
  Other agencies such as the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Food and 
Drug Administration, University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service, United States 
Department of Agriculture, and Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality will also support 
the response in their specific areas of expertise.
  Actions under ESF #11 to protect, conserve, rehabilitate, recover, and restore Natural and 
Cultural Resources and
 Historic Properties (NCH 
Œ Natural Cultural Historic) are guided by 
the existing internal policies and procedures of the owning agency for the affected NCH 
resource. 
      2021 ESF #11 Agriculture and Natural Resources, Pg. 
150
  Concept of Operations
 General
 The Arkansas Department of Agriculture, as the coordina
tor for ESF #11, organizes and 
coordinates the capabilities and resources of state government to facilitate the delivery of services, 
technical assistance, expertise, and other support for incidents that impact Arkansas under the scope of 
ESF #11.
 ESF #11 
provides for an integrated Federal, State, and local response to incidents within its 
sphere of influence. ESF #11 ensures the safety and security of the commercial supply of food following 
such an incident and mitigates the effect of the incident on the p
opulation and environment.
 To protect, conserve, rehabilitate, recover, and restore NCH resources, ESF #11 organizes and 
coordinates resources to facilitate the delivery of services, technical assistance, expertise, and other 
support throughout all phases 
of an incident.
 ESF #11 addresses the potential for outbreaks of animal/plant disease and infestation and 
provides guidance for precautionary measures. If a possible intentional pathogen release is detected, 
ESF #11 notifies the USDA™s Office of Inspector 
General immediately.
 If an outbreak of animal/plant disease/infestation should require quarantine or may impact 
commerce, ESF #11 will provide pertinent information and recommendations. It will conduct field 
investigations and provide technical assistance 
and consultation as required.
 ESF #11 inspects slaughter and processing plants, distribution facilities and retail sites. It 
engages in laboratory analysis activities to screen food products for contaminants. It suspends 
processing plants as appropriate an
d follows up on consumer complaints. ESF #11 also conducts product 
tracing to determine the source, destination, and disposition of adulterated and/or contaminated 
products.
 Through its support agencies, ESF #11 provides scientific and technical advice, in
formation, and 
assistance to maintain NCH resources. Logistical links have been established with organizations involved 
in long
-term NCH resource preservation.
 ESF #11 coordinates the inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, an
d 
destruction of animals or articles found to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous 
infection to human beings and takes other such measures as necessary. 
   2021 ESF #11 Agriculture and Natural Resources, Pg. 
151
  ESF #11 assesses the status of food processing facilities in areas affected by
 disaster regardless 
of whether it originates with an outbreak of animal/plant disease/infestation. It evaluates the adequacy 
of available inspectors, program investigators, and laboratory services relative to the emergency.
 ESF #11 coordinates provision o
f necessary assistance to protect NCH resources within a disaster 
affected area.

  Introduction
  The ESF #12 
Œ Energy annex to the Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan gives 
guidance for the coordination of the restoration of damage
d energy systems and components during a 
potential or actual disaster.   Under the leadership of the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC), 
ESF #12 is an integral part of the responsibility to maintain continuous and reliable energy supplies for 
the St
ate of Arkansas through preventative measures as well as restorative actions.  
  Policies
  Restoration of normal operations at energy facilities is the responsibility of the facility owners.
  ESF #12 addresses significant disruptions in energy supplies for a
ny reason, whether caused by 
physical disruption of energy transmission and distribution systems or unexpected operational 
failure of such systems. ESF #12 also recognizes that damage to telecommunications facilities 
may disrupt or impair the operation of 
other utility and energy delivery systems and 
components.
  ESF #12 addresses the impact that damage to an energy system in one geographic region may 
have on energy supplies, systems, and components in other regions relying on the same 
system. Consequently, 
energy supply and transportation problems can be intrastate, interstate, 
and international.
  Concept of Operations
 General
 While restoration of normal operations at energy facilities is the primary responsibility of the 
owners of those facilities, ESF #12 
provides the appropriate supplemental State assistance and resources 
to enable restoration in a timely manner. Collectively, the coordinating and support agencies that 
comprise ESF #12:
  Serve as the focal point within State Government for receipt of inform
ation on actual or 
potential damage to energy supply and distribution systems. 
   2021 ESF #12 Energy, Pg. 
157
   Serve as the focal point within State Government regarding requirements for system design 
and operations, and on procedures for preparedness, prevention, recovery, and restorat
ion;
  Advise State and local authorities on priorities for energy restoration, assistance, and supply;
  Assist industry, State, and local authorities with requests for emergency response actions as 
they pertain to the State™s energy supply;
  Assist department
s and agencies by locating fuel for transportation, communications, and 
emergency operations;
  Recommend actions to conserve fuel and electric power; and
  Provide energy supply information and guidance on the conservation and efficient use of 
energy to State
 and local governments and to the public.

and coordinates repair and restoration of energy systems.
  In coordination with State and local governments, APSC prioritizes plans and actions for the
 restoration of energy during response and recovery operations.
  Local:  
Local governments have primary responsibility for prioritizing the restoration of energy 
facilities within their jurisdictions.
  Private Sector:  
The private sector owns and operates 
the majority of the State™s energy 
infrastructure and participates along with the APSC in developing best practices for infrastructure design 
and operations.
 The private sector will normally take the lead in the rapid restoration of infrastructure
-related 
services after an incident occurs. Appropriate entities of the private sector are integrated into 
ESF #12 planning and decision
-making processes.
    2021 ESF #12 Energy, Pg.

Pg. 162  Introduction
  Purpose
 The purp
ose of this ESF is to integrate state public safety and security capabilities and resources 
to support the full range of incident management activities associated with potential or actual incidents 
of statewide significance.
 Scope
 ESF #13 is responsible fo
r providing a mechanism for coordinating and providing state support 
to local authorities to include criminal law enforcement, public safety, and security capabilities and 
resources during potential or actual incidents of significance. 
 ESF #13 capabilitie
s support incident management requirements including force and critical 
infrastructure protection, security planning and technical assistance, technology support, and public 
safety in both pre
-incident and post incident situations. ESF #13 generally is act
ivated in situations 
requiring extensive assistance to provide public safety and security and where local government 
resources are overwhelmed or are inadequate, or in pre
-incident or post
-incident situations that require 
protective solutions or capabiliti
es unique to state government. Aid may include manpower, equipment 
and/or technical expertise for consultation purposes.
 Policies
 State, local, private
-sector, and specific federal authorities have primary responsibility for public 
safety and security, and
 typically are the first line of response and support in these functional areas.
 In most incident situations, local jurisdictions have primary authority and responsibility for law 
enforcement activities, utilizing the Incident Command System (ICS) on
-scene
.  Through ESF #13, state resources supplement local resources when requested or required, as 
appropriate, and are integrated into the incident command structure using National Incident 
Management System (NIMS) principles and protocols.
 ESF #13 facilitates
 coordination among supporting agencies to ensure that communication and 
coordination processes are consistent with stated incident management missions and objectives.
    2021 ESF #13 Public Safety, 
Pg. 163  When activated, ESF #13 coordinates the implementation of state authorities that are 
app
ropriate for the situation and may provide protection and security resources, planning assistance, 
technology support, and other technical assistance to support incident operations, consistent with state 
agency authorities and resource availability.
 ESF#13
 does not usurp or override the policies or mutual aid agreements of any local jurisdiction 
or government, state government, or federal agency. Law enforcement activities and criminal 
investigations are conducted in conformance with existing codes and stat
utes.
 ESF #13 provides the conduit for utilizing and incorporating the extensive network of public 
safety and security coordination established by interstate and intrastate prevention efforts through a 
variety of interagency plans. 
 Concept of Operations
  General
 Activation of ESF #13 will include actions taken to provide for the protection of the state™s 
citizens and visitors during an emergency or disaster and ensures that those actions conform to 
applicable state law, rules, regulations and policy.  Oper
ations under ESF #13 will commence once local 
jurisdictions have exhausted their law enforcement capabilities and have requested assistance.
  Actions
 ESF #13 is activated when state public safety and security capabilities and resources are needed 
to suppor
t incident operations. This includes threat or pre
-incident as well as post incident situations. 
 When activated, the primary agencies assess public safety and security needs, and respond to 
requests for state resources and planning/technical assistance fr
om local or state governments, or other 
ESF™s.
 ESF #13 maintains close coordination with state and local officials to determine public safety 
and security support requirements and to jointly determine resource priorities. The primary agencies 
maintain comm
unications with supporting agencies to determine capabilities, assess the availability of 
resources, and track resources that have been deployed.
    2021 ESF #13 Public Safety, 
Pg. 164  The ESF #13 coordinating agency will prepare a situation analysis by reviewing reports, video, 
message traffic
, status boards, and logs (ref ASP EOP, Pre
-Event Report, Sec. 2.0, Page 12). This situation 
analysis continues throughout the response and short
-term recovery phase and will include the 
following:
  A general description of the situation as it pertains to E
SF #13 and an analysis of the ESF™s 
operational support requirements.
  A prioritized listing of significant actions that the ESF #13 will initiate to provide operational 
support.
  Initiation of notification of the required personnel and support organizations
 to achieve the 
required level of response.
  Mobilization of resources and coordinate response for approved mission assignments
  Preparation of electronic briefings on status of ESF #13 response operations.
  Preparation of an ESF #13 After
-Action Report (AAR)
 to identify lessons learned and 
improvements needed (
ref ASP EOP, AAR, Sec. 3.0, Page 14).

 Introduction
 Purpose
 Emergency Support Function (ESF) #14 supports the coordination of private sector operations
 among infrastructure owners and operators, businesses, and their government partners. The annex 
describes the mech
anism for entities that are not aligned with an ESF to be integrated into state 
emergency management. ESF #14 facilitates business
-led, government
-supported incident response for 
well
-coordinated public and private operations. 
 This annex describes the pol
icies, responsibilities, and concept of operations for State incident 
management activities involving the private sector during incidents requiring a coordinated State 
response. It focuses on the relationship between the State and partners in the private s
ector.
     2021 ESF #14 Private Sector and Infrastructure, Pg. 
169
  Scope
 This annex applies to all State agencies operating under the Arkansas
 Comprehensive 
Emergency Management Plan (ARCEMP) 
in incidents requiring a coordinated State response that 
involves the private sector in any of the following ways: 
  An imp
acted organization or infrastructure is owned or controlled privately
  A private sector resource has the capability to increase the effectiveness of the State 
response. 
  The responsible party for an incident is part of the private sector.
  A member of the Pr
ivate Sector Working Group is involved in some aspect of the incident.
  A private sector entity is involved in any phase of emergency management 
Œ prevention, 
protection, mitigation, response, and/or recovery.
 This annex addresses those aspects of incident 
management regarding the private sector that 
must be emphasized because of their uniqueness or importance. One such aspect is service to special 
needs populations before, during, and after disaster.
 This annex does not alter existing private sector respons
ibilities for emergency management 
under the law. Existing contractual or other legal obligations are not affected by this annex.
 Policies
 The State encourages cooperative relations between private sector organizations and state and 
local authorities regar
ding prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery activities. 
  The State supports the development and updating of voluntary preparedness standards. A 
private sector firm that complies with the appropriate standards will benefit from its co
mpliance both in 
its preparedness and its ability to promote public awareness of its compliance. 
  The State encourages processes that support informed cooperative decision making. It takes 
actions that engage the private sector at the strategic (e.g., chi
ef executive officer (CEO), corporate 
president, or other senior leadership, etc.) and operational levels to ensure: 
  Effective and efficient use of private sector and State resources. 
  Timely exchange of information. 
  Public and market confidence in times
 of crisis or catastrophe. 
   2021 ESF #14 Private Sector and Infrastructure, Pg. 
170
   The State advocates extensive multidirectional information sharing between the public and 
private sectors regarding operational information and situational awareness relative to potential or 
actual incidents. The State works co
operatively to develop and apply processes, procedures, and 
communications protocols that support such sharing at the strategic and/or leadership and operational 
levels. 
  The State encourages members of the Critical Infrastructure (CI) community to organi
ze sector
-coordinating and information
-sharing mechanisms suitable for their sectors or areas of concern.
 The State supports owners and operators of those infrastructure elements whose disruption 
may have state or local impact. The State promotes the devel
opment of appropriate emergency 
response plans and information
-sharing processes and protocols tailored to the unique requirements of 
their respective sectors or industries.  Such plans and processes will be aligned with State and local 
emergency response 
plans and information
-sharing networks. 
  The State encourages private sector organizations to develop and maintain capabilities needed 
to respond to and manage a complete spectrum of incidents and emergencies, except in cases where 
the capabilities are in
herently governmental in nature. ESF #14 is intended to incorporate the 
capabilities that already exist in the private sector into the emergency management mission.
  In certain circumstances, Federal law requires authorities to include private sector 
repre
sentatives in incident management planning, operations, and exercises; when not required, it 
encourages such participation whenever practical. 
  The State may direct private sector response resources in some cases in which contractual 
relationships exist. 
The Government also retains its full authorities to oversee and control infrastructure 
involved in an incident.
  The State treats information provided by the private sector, from receipt through destruction, in 
a manner consistent with applicable statutes 
and regulations. These handling procedures include 
safeguarding Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) in accordance with the Critical 
Infrastructure Information Act of 2002, providing exemption from the Freedom of Information Act
 (Public Law
 89-554, 80 Stat. 383; Amended 1996, 2002, 2007)
 requested disclosure(s) and protecting 
appropriately designated proprietary, or otherwise sensitive, company information from unauthorized 
disclosure. 
   2021 ESF #14 Private Sector and Infrastructure, Pg. 
171
   The State avoids actions that disrupt existing relatio
nships between voluntary aid providers at 
the local, state, or national level when eliciting additional offers of goods and services. 
  The State conducts after
-action critiques of the procedures detailed in this annex with private 
sector participants.  In
 an effort to improve upon these procedures, when deemed necessary the State 
shares these critiques with the relevant local, state and federal entities and private sector participants. 
  The State supports measures that ensure site accessibility for essent
ial services providers 
responding to disasters or emergencies. Essential services providers, as defined in the Stafford Act as 
amended by Public Law 109
-347, include: ﬁ(a) a municipal entity; (b) a nonprofit entity; or (c) a private, 
for
-profit entityﬂ tha
t contributes to efforts to respond to an emergency or major disaster. These 
entities provide: 
  Telecommunications service; 
  Electrical power; 
  Natural gas; 
  Water and sewer services;
  Emergency medical services; or 
  Other essential services 
 The state will
 take advantage of opportunities to create indemnity.
  Assumptions
 Readers of this annex are familiar with the Basic Plan section of the Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency 
Management Plan.
  Community lifelines rely on interdependent critical infrastructure se
ctors and complex 
supply chains.
  Disruptions in one sector can rapidly cascade across others and disrupt related supply 
chains. 
  Business and infrastructure owners and operators have unequalled expertise to manage 
their systems and have the authorities, ca
pabilities, and resources necessary to stabilize 
community lifelines. 
  Business and Infrastructure owners and operators are expected to consider their risk of 
liability or business losses as they make decisions in emergencies.
   2021 ESF #14 Private Sector and Infrastructure, Pg. 
172
  Concept of Operations
 General
  ESF #14 will provide private sector partners with situational awareness. ESF #14, with the 
support of other ESFs, analyzes the 
requirements for stabilizing lifelines and restoring critical supply 
chains. Analysis will identify potential cascading impacts
. ESF #14 will collect and share data regarding 
statewide business and infrastructure status, impacts, factors limiting commercial exchange, and other 
economic drivers for the incident.
 ESF #14 will identify and report on cross
-sector interdependencies. Th
ese reports support 
decision makers on effective prioritization, sequencing of response activities, and efforts to re
-establish 
damaged lifelines, reduce cascading effects, and meet survivor needs. ESF #14 ill ensure organizations 
have the information requ
ired to make informed incident
-related decisions to promote recovery.
  ESF #14 will 
share information, as private sector partners permit, about the status of critical 
infrastructure and businesses, response activities, and persistent vulnerabilities as the
 disaster 
progresses
. It will support private sector and infrastructure owner and operator needs and priorities, 
and coordinate with 
affected jurisdictions in critical infrastructure restoration activities. 
 The private sector is encouraged to follow the o
perational concept for incident management 
specified in the National Incident Management System (NIMS). 
  The concept of operations in this annex covers the specific organizations and actions required to 
effectively and efficiently integrate incident manag
ement operations with the private sector. 
 State resources cannot be used to assist a private entity. However, at no additional cost to the 
state, a board exists in the state™s incident management software 
Œ WebEOC 
Œ for private sector. The 
board provides 
a forum where private sector partners can communicate and support each other™s 
participation in response and recovery.
     2021 ESF #14 Private Sector and Infrastructure, Pg. 
173
  Organization
 The private sector includes for
-profit and nonprofit organizations, formal and informal 
structures, commerce, and industri
es that comprise the economy and are not part of a government 
structure. 
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO) are a distinct category of organizations within the 
private sector. An NGO is a non
-profit group that functions independently of any government. T
hey are 
sometimes called civil societies. They are organized on community, national, and/or international levels 
to serve a social or political goal such as humanitarian causes or the environment. NGOs provide 
services to their members and others.
 The Arka
nsas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) is the lead coordinating agency for 
ESF #14. Support agencies and private sector partners contribute to response and recovery under the 
management of the coordinating agency. ESF #14 representatives, both coordi
nating and supporting, 
participate in pre
-incident planning meetings and pre
- and post
- incident coordinating activities. 
 When the State EOC raises the activation level, it may request that support agencies send a 
representative to work in the State EOC. 
The State EOC may also request that private sector partners 
Œ for profit, not for profit, and/or volunteer entities 
Œ send staff to the State EOC, particularly those 
organizations with a large role to play in the current disaster. 
 ESF #14 provides busines
ses, NGOs, and infrastructure owners and operators with an integrated 
ﬁtouch pointﬂ to support private sector response operations. ESF #14 develops recommendations to 
expedite supply chain and community lifeline restoration and provides those recommendatio
ns to ESF 
#5. 
 ADEM™s Deputy Director of Preparedness serves as the Private Sector Liaison coordinating 
working group meetings/calls.
     2021 ESF #14 Private Sector and Infrastructure, Pg. 
174
  Intended Outcomes
  ESF #14 will benefit both the private and public sectors during incident response in a variety of 
way
s. Stabilization of community lifelines will maximize the number of survivors who have access to 
essential services. Businesses that maintain continuity of operations plans and emergency capabilities in 
anticipation of disaster will be most instrumental in
 this return to normal operations.
 Infrastructure owners and operators, businesses, and government agencies working together 
can prevent or mitigate cascading failures across multiple sectors to maintain supply chains and 
distribution networks. Achieving t
his in the affected area will protect public health and safety, restore 
business functions, and reduce economic impacts. . .
 Elimination of redundant points of contact for businesses during operations minimizes 
conflicting government guidance on response p
riorities. Information will be shared with private sector 
partners through the various ESFs 
Œ consistent with the state™s existing emergency management 
practices. 
 Effective coordination at the local level between government and critical infrastructure own
ers 
and operators ensures that national security installations have the lifeline services necessary to help 
support national security interests and functions. 
 Relationship with the State EOC and Emergency Management Structure
 ESF #14 follows the principle
 that incident response is locally executed, state coordinated, and 
federally supported. 
 Businesses and critical infrastructure sectors essential for maintaining and stabilizing community 
lifelines are represented in Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) ope
rated by state and local 
governments. These relationships provide the foundation for coordinating business
-led, government
-supported private sector operations. These relationships also offer the foundation for multi
-sector 
planning and exercises that enabl
e readiness.
 Requests for assistance from the private sector are typically reviewed by impacted jurisdictions 
or within multiagency coordination centers, such as EOCs. Government will collaborate with private 
sector partners to collect, assess, prioritize,
 and 
Œ to the maximum extent possible, consistent with 
  2021 ESF #14 Private Sector and Infrastructure, Pg. 
175
  applicable laws and regulations 
Œ support private sector requirements. Through the State EOC, Arkansas 
will forward requests to the federal government if local and state assets are inadequate for meeti
ng 
requests for assistance to stabilize the infrastructure that supports a municipality.
 Information received from the private sector is reported to government coordinating agencies. 
These assessments of the impact of disasters on the private sector and cr
itical infrastructure make it 
possible to identify, and perhaps mitigate, events that will worsen the situation before they happen.

 ADEM
 facilitate
s and encourages the organization of industry sectors to cooperate on 
information sharing and other prevention and mitigation activities. One method for accomplishing this 
sharing of information within the private sector is through the InfraGard organizati
on.  InfraGard is a 
Federal Bureau of Investigation program of information sharing and analysis. Its membership is made up 
of businesses, academic institutions, State and local law enforcement agencies and other participants 
dedicated to sharing informatio
n and intelligence. Infragard serves the interests of its members and uses 
their combined knowledge bases to prevent hostile acts against the United States.  . 
 A private sector working group has been established to assist federal, State, or local 
coordina
tion centers or field offices to facilitate interaction, communication, and coordination with the 
private sector. The group is comprised of private entity partners who are integrated into the state™s 
emergency management program. 
 Having this trusted group
 of private sector partners facilitates information sharing. The 
existence of this group increases the number of first hand observers who can provide information to 
inform both local and state response operations. Information will also flow out from govern
ment to 
private sector. This enables the private sector partners to support their employees and return to 
business as usual as quickly as possible. A community cannot recover until its businesses recover.

  Introduction
 Purpose
 The purpose of this ESF is to ensure that sufficient State assets work to deliver accurate, timely 
information during incidents requiring a coordinated Sta
te response to affected audiences including 
governments, media, the private sector and the local populace.  ESF #15 is a Joint Information System 
(JIS).
 Scope
 ESF #15 coordinates the State™s actions to provide the required external affairs support to State
, 
local, and if necessary Federal incident management elements.  This annex details the establishment of 
support positions to coordinate communications to various audiences.  ESF #15 applies to all State 
entities that may require public affairs support or 
who™s public affairs assets may be utilized during an 
incident.
 The provisions of this annex apply to any incidents where significant interagency coordination is 
required.
 Policies
 State planning for external affairs functions recognizes local governments™
 responsibility to 
provide information to their citizens.  
 Nothing in this document should be construed as diminishing or usurping those responsibilities. 
In the event that local governments are unable to perform these functions, the State may provide 
inf
ormation to the affected population.
 Since ESF #15 integrates various functional areas, primary and support agencies are encouraged 
to participate in ESF #15 training and exercises to ensure that their personnel are able to execute their 
responsibilities a
nd achieve unity of effort when the ESF is activated. 
 Integration and teamwork among Federal, State and Local authorities is essential.  Local 
authorities are encouraged to contact Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) Public 
Affairs as they re
lease initial or follow
-up information.  ADEM Public Affairs engages with local and 
affected private
-sector counterparts as soon as possible during an actual or potential incident to 
synchronize overall incident communications to the public.
 The external a
ffairs efforts are coordinated in support of a unified message.
    2021 ESF #15 External Affairs, Pg. 
181
  Concept of Operations
 General
 During an incident, Federal, State and Local authorities share responsibility for communicating 
with the public regarding the incident. Meeting this responsibili
ty is a critical component of incident 
management and must be fully integrated with all other operational actions to ensure delivery of 
pertinent information to those directly affected by the incident.
 Dissemination of incident information to the general p
ublic
 ESF #15 has four components:
  Public Affairs
  Legislative/Congressional Affairs
  Local Coordination

  Introduction
 Purpose
 The purpose of this ESF is to organize policies, organizations, actions, and responsibilities for a 
coordinated approach to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber
-related incidents affecting 
critical s
tate government and educational processes.
 Scope
 Cybersecurity is the process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and responding 
to attacks. 
 The Annex describes a framework that may be utilized in any incident of state significance with 
cyber
-related issues, including significant cyber threats, disruptions, and crippling cyber
-attacks against 
state critical infrastructure information systems. 
      2021 ESF #16 Cybersecurity, Pg. 
186
 Policies
 Cybersecurity is listed in the National Preparedness Goal as a Core Capability under t
he 
Protection Mission and it poses its own unique challenges. Cybersecurity information networks inform 
situational awareness, enable incident response, and support the resiliency of key systems.
  Arkansas will protect/restore electronic communications syst
ems, information, and services 
from damage, unauthorized use, and exploitation.
  Arkansas will implement risk
-informed guidelines, regulations, and standards to ensure the 
security, reliability, integrity, and availability of critical information, records, 
and 
communications systems and services through collaborative cybersecurity initiatives and 
efforts.
  Arkansas will implement and maintain procedures to detect malicious activity and to 
conduct technical and investigative
-based countermeasures, mitigations,
 and operations 
against malicious actors to counter existing and emerging cyber
-based threats, consistent 
with established protocols.
  Concept of Operations
 Cybersecurity threats exploit the increased complexity and connectivity of critical infrastructure 
systems, placing the State™s security, economy, and public safety and health at risk. Malicious cyber 
activity can have catastrophic consequences, which in turn, can lead to other hazards, such as power 
grid failures or financial system failures. These cas
cading hazards increase the potential impact of cyber 
incidents.
 The Division of Information Systems
 is the focal point for cyber information on the state™s 
network, which provides internet and network connectivity to state agencies, institutions of higher
 education, public schools, and some county and city governments. DIS will coordinate response to cyber 
incidents to minimize damage. DIS™ responsibilities include:
  Providing indications and warnings of potential threats, attacks, and incidents;
  Reporting 
cyber incidents to ADEM;
  Reporting cyber Incidents from Arkansas Multi Agency Insurance Trust Fund (AMAIT) 
participating agencies to the Arkansas multi
-agency cyber insurance program.
  Information
-sharing both inside and outside the government, including be
st practices, 
investigative information, coordination of incident response, and incident mitigation;
   2021 ESF #16 Cybersecurity, Pg. 
187
  Analyzing cyber
-attacks;
  Providing technical assistance;
  Assisting law enforcement with cyber related investigations, forensics analysis, and 
prosecution;
  Attributing the source of cyber
-attack; and
  Direct and assist agencies in removing known sources of attack from within the state 
network.
 Lead Coordinating Agency Activities
 Division of Information Systems.
  Personnel from the Department of Information Sys
tems™ 
divisions make up the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).  
 Emergency Response Actions. 
Upon detection of a threat or significant event on the state 
network, the Department of Information Systems CERT meets to determine appropriate action to 
mit
igate damage. Communications can take place by fax, voice, or email depending on availability of 
infrastructure and the nature of the communication. Communications can include methods of 
prevention, instructions for cleaning infected machines, requests to 
disconnect infected machines, 
updates on the general health of the network and other types of communication.
 During a significant incident, the Division of Information Systems will report information to the 
Arkansas multi
-agency cyber insurance program, AD
EM, and the Multi
-State Information Sharing and 
Analysis Center (MS
-ISAC) which can share the information with the United States Computer Emergency 
Readiness Team (US
-CERT) of the Department of Homeland Security. The Division of Information 
Systems may als
o consult with the InfraGard Arkansas Members Alliance chapter, an FBI
-sponsored 
group of public and private organizations sharing information related to cyber and physical security.
 Challenges and Considerations. 
The state network supports most Arkansas g
overnment 
agencies that provide critical services, including those that support public safety and public health. Most 
local law enforcement personnel depend on the state network to provide current, accurate information. 
The technical personnel within state
 agencies must keep up with current technologies. Redundant 
systems must be maintained in the state network and the continuity of operations plans created by the 
state agencies must continue to be maintained and exercised.

  Introduction
 Policies
 The State of Arkansas follows the federal definition for each category of animal: 
  Service Animals: Service animal means any animal that is individually trained to do work or 
perform tasks for the benefit of an individual w
ith a disability, including a physical, sensory, 
psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. The work or tasks performed by a service 
animal must be directly related to the handler´s disability. Under the Americans With 
Disabilities Act (ADA) re
gulations, service animals have access to the same facilities as the 
humans they serve. 
  Household Pets: A domesticated animal, such as a dog, cat, bird, rodent, or turtle that is 
traditionally kept in the home for pleasure rather than for commercial purpo
ses and that 
can travel in commercial carriers and be housed in temporary facilities.  Household pets do 
not include reptiles (except turtles), amphibians, fish, insects/arachnids, farm animals 
(including horses), and animals kept for racing purposes.
  Anim
als for Commercial Use: Any animal used for consumption, or to support the owner™s 
economic welfare.
 Veterinarians residing in each county are the first line of response to emergencies involving 
animals or animal food products in their communities. Animal 
control personnel augment their services.
 Household pets are typically not allowed in shelters for humans. Arrangements for household 
pets are generally the responsibility of the pet owners. However, nothing contained within the confines 
of this Animal Sup
port Annex shall be construed as limiting the voluntary agencies from exceeding the 
minimum requirements concerning household pets and service animals. If resources are available, the 
State will facilitate shelter of other animals affected by disaster. 
 Ac
tions taken in responding to an emergency that requires activation of the Animal Support 
Annex will be coordinated through the Arkansas Department of Agriculture, Livestock and Poultry 
Division. The Livestock and Poultry Division coordinates with agencies 
affiliated with appropriate 
Emergency Support Functions (ESFs):
   2021 
Animal Support Annex, Pg. 
191
   ESF #6 
Œ Mass Care, Emergency Assistance, Temporary Housing, and Human Services will 
encourage local entities to plan for the collocation of pet shelters near general populations 
when possible
 during evacuations. 
  ESF #8 
Œ Public Health and Medical Services will assist in epidemiological monitoring and 
reporting of emergency
-related animal health issues and with management of human 
bite/injury cases. 
  ESF #15 
Œ External Affairs will work with S
tate and local authorities to ensure that animal 
rescue and response instructions and status updates are communicated appropriately and 
in a timely manner. 
  Concept of Operations
 The Arkansas Department of Agriculture, Livestock and Poultry Division will 
coordinate with the 
support partners listed above to locate temporary shelter for household pets consistent with Federal 
laws and with the terms and conditions of any relevant Memorandums of Understanding or 
Agreements. Pet sheltering will be conducted in 
conjunction with human evacuation and sheltering 
efforts. Pets should be sheltered near their owners whenever possible. Owners will, to the best of their 
ability, provide food, water, husbandry, and exercise for their pets during the time they are in 
emerg
ency shelters.
 The Livestock and Poultry Division, in coordination with local governments, will identify and 
provide locations where household pets may be sheltered; provide specifications for vehicles that can 
be used to transport household pets; coordina
te with private industry for household pet sheltering; 
provide logistical support for the transportation, care, immunization, and quarantine of household pets; 
and provide coordination of animal owner identification, tracking, reunification, and social sup
port. 
 A devastating attack or the threat of an attack on the domestic animal population through use 
of highly infective exotic disease or pest infestation could result in severe economic loss. Early detection, 
allowing for early intervention, will come fr
om agriculture expert reports as well as unusual patterns 
revealed by surveillance systems. 
     2021 
Animal Support Annex, Pg. 
192
  All animal depopulation activities are conducted as humanely as possible while stopping 
pathogen spread and limiting the number of animals that must be euthanize
d. Disposal methods for 
infected or potentially infected carcasses and plant host material are chosen for their effectiveness in 
stopping pathogen spread and for their minimal impact on the environment.
 If a possible intentional pathogen or pest release is
 reported, animal or plant health authorities 
immediately notify United States Department of Agriculture™s (USDA) Office of Inspector General (OIG), 
which in turn contacts the National Operations Center. As the situation warrants, the USDA OIG notifies 
and
 coordinates with the appropriate law enforcement agencies at the local, State, and Federal levels.

  Introduction
  Purpose 
  This annex describes policies, roles and responsibilities, and the concept of operations for 
assessing, prioritizing, protecting, and resto
ring Critical Infrastructure (CI) of the State during actual or 
potential incidents. The annex details processes to ensure coordination and integration of CI
-related 
activities among a wide array of public and private incident managers and CI security part
ners within 
immediate incident areas. Specifically, this annex does the following: 
  Describes roles and responsibilities for CI preparedness, protection, response, recovery, 
restoration, and continuity of operations. 
  Establishes a concept of operations fo
r incident
-related CI preparedness, protection, 
response, recovery, and restoration.
  Outlines incident
-related actions (including pre
-response and post
-response) to expedite 
information sharing and analysis of actual or potential impacts to CI and facilita
tes requests 
for assistance and information from public
- and private
-sector partners. 
 Scope
   This annex addresses integration of the CI protection and restoration mission as a vital 
component of the State™s unified approach to incident management. 
   Cri
tical infrastructure includes those assets, systems, networks, and functions
Šphysical or 
virtual
Šso vital to the State that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on 
security, national economic security, public health or safet
y, or any combination of those matters. 
   CI is organized into 16 sectors (see Table 2) that together provide essential functions and 
services supporting various aspects of the State government, economy, and society. 
   Processes outlined herein apply to 
State government departments and agencies during incidents 
with potential or actual CI impacts
Šand may apply to, or involve, incident managers and security 
partners at other levels of government and the private sector, including CI owners and operators.
      2021 CI Support Annex, Pg. 
199
  Policies 
    Consistent with the Federal policies mentioned above, procedures have been developed to 
coordinate prevention activities and prevent incidents. Further information can be found in the 
document titled Critical Infrastructure Protection Branch 
Prevention, Protection and Response 
Procedures.
   HSPD
-7 charges the Secretary of Homeland Security with responsibility for coordinating the 
overall national effort to enhance the protection of the CI of the United States.  
 This annex does not alter or su
persede existing:
  Statutory responsibilities for CI protection, incident management, emergency management, 
or other related functions under the law.
  Regulatory, contractual, or other legal relationships between State agencies and the private 
sector.
  Conce
pt of Operations
   The concept of operations describes approaches, processes, coordinating structures and 
incident
-related actions required for the protection and restoration of CI assets, systems, networks, or 
functions within and outside the impacted are
a. The processes described herein are detailed further in 
standard operating procedures and other related guidance. 
 Specifically, the concept of operations focuses on processes and actions for CI
-related:
  Situational awareness. 
  Impact assessments and ana
lysis. 
  Information sharing. 
  Requests for assistance or information from private
-sector CI owners and operators.
  General
   Addressing CI
-related prevention, protection, preparedness, response, and recovery requires 
cooperation and collaboration between a
nd among CI entities. A primary objective of this collaborative 
effort between the private
-sector owners and operators; State and local governments; 
nongovernmental organizations; and the Federal government is to ensure that resources are applied 
  2021 CI Support Annex, Pg. 
200
  where the
y offer the most benefit for mitigating risk, deterring threats, and minimizing the 
consequences of incidents.
   The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) is responsible for leading, integrating, 
and coordinating the overall effort to enhance CI
 protection. Responsibilities for CI support that are 
most applicable during incident response include:
  Identifying, prioritizing, and coordinating action in support of the protection of critical 
assets, systems, and networks, with a particular focus on CI
 that could be exploited to cause 
catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those produced by a weapon 
of mass destruction.
 o Tier I/Tier II List: This is a DHS program referred to as the National Data Call (NDC) which 
identifies nationall
y significant, high
-consequence assets and systems within the State. 
Assets and systems identified through this program include those that, if destroyed or 
disrupted, could cause some combination of significant casualties, major economic 
losses, or widespr
ead and long
-term disruptions to national well
-being and governance 
capability.  As part of the NDC the State proposes CI assets to DHS annually.  DHS 
reviews the asset nominations and the justification for nomination provided by the 
state.  These assets a
re either approved or rejected as Tier I or Tier II assets. The 
Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) is the lead agency for this 
program.

  Ensuring sensitive CI related information is handled and safeguarded in accordance with the 
Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) program or other appropriate guidelines. 
The PCII Program, which operates under the authority of the Critic
al Infrastructure 
Information (CII) Act of 2002, provides a means for sharing private
-sector information with 
the government while providing assurances that the information will be exempt from public 
disclosure and will be properly safeguarded. 
 This progr
am defines the requirements for submitting critical infrastructure information as well 
as the requirements that government entities must meet for accessing and safeguarding PCII.  ADEM 
maintains the PCII Officer position for the State.
  Private
-sector CI ow
ners and operators are responsible at the corporate and individual 
facility levels for risk and incident management planning, security, and preparedness 
investments. 
  Organizational Structure
 CI Support for Incident Management Actions.  
The CI support fun
ction is structured to apply the 
NIPP risk management framework to produce prioritized recommendations for CI protection and 
restoration in the context of incident management. ADEM, support agencies, and other government and 
private
-sector security partner
s continuously conduct situational awareness assessments, analyses, 
information
-sharing activities and facilitate requests for information and assistance through normal 
activities to better prepare for response, recovery, and restoration actions during an 
incident. Key 
elements of these daily CI support missions include:
 Situational Awareness.
  Monitoring information flow and threats to become aware of an incident or potential 
incident.
  Reviewing CI data and data inventories.
   2021 CI Support Annex, Pg. 
204
   Identifying opportunities for mi
tigation.
  Identifying appropriate response posture for CI elements and resources.
  Providing information to ADEM Recovery Branch regarding restoration of functions, services 
and programs, vital resources, facilities, and infrastructure in affected areas.
 Assessments and Analyses.

-sector relationships in order to assess CI needs and 
vulnerabilities.
  Collaborating in preparation for more in
-depth assessments and analyses during an 
incident.
 Information Sharing.
  Participating
 in multidirectional information flow between government and private
-sector 
security partners.
  Developing and providing a comprehensive current operating picture (COP) of threats and 
hazards to CI.
  Providing security partners with a robust communications n
etwork, including a common set 
of communications, coordination, and information
-sharing capabilities.
  Providing a means for county governments, local governments, and private
-sector security 
partners to be integrated, as appropriate, into the intelligence 
cycle.
  Maintaining the state™s Infrastructure Protection Gateway (IP Gateway). ADEM houses the 
state™s IP Gateway administrator.
 Requests for Information/Assistance.
  Facilitating real
-time transmission of requests and status. 
  Maintaining a comprehensive l
og and retrievable database of all requests.
 During daily operations, ADEM, State support agencies, the State Fusion Center, and the Joint 
Terrorism Task Force disseminate a range of all
-hazards information products and CI protection 
information to securit
y partners.  Information dissemination includes the following:
  Threat
-related and other all
-hazards information products to government and private
-sector 
CI security partners, as appropriate.
  Reports from private sector on suspicious activity or potential 
threats to CI.
   2021 CI Support Annex, Pg. 
205
   Requests for information and requests for assistance.
 Pre
-response/Initial Actions
. Transition from daily operational to pre
-response incident
-related 
activities begins with warning of a potential incident or the notification of an incident.
 CI Information, Assessment, and Analytical Products
. Examples of information, assessment, and 
analytical products include:
  Incident Reports: Evaluate information received initially through news media, Internet, CI 
owners and operators, and other sources.
  Spot Reports: Provide current situation status and operational snapshot assessment of 
operational CI effects from emerging incidents.
  Threat Warnings: Fuse all source information to provide analysis of emergent threats on a 
timely basis.
 ADEM houses the st
ate™s Critical Infrastructure Protection Branch. The branch consists of a 
Branch Manager and two intelligence analysts. The analysts support the staff of the State Fusion Center. 
Each analyst is responsible for specific sectors within the state™s critical 
infrastructure systems.
 Notification and Reporting
 ADEM is responsible for coordinating CI incident notification and information sharing among 
State and local entities and CI owners/operators. Established DHS systems, such as the Homeland 
Security Informat
ion Network (HSIN), COP, Critical Infrastructure Warning Network, and other sector
-based information
-sharing mechanisms, are used to create CI situational awareness in support of 
incident operations.
 Upon notification of a potential or actual incident: 
  AD
EM assets coordinate with applicable State and local government agencies to 
communicate pertinent information.  
  ADEM will work with the law enforcement communities to assess State security threats. The 
State Fusion Center and other information sharing ass
ets will bring together both 
intelligence and infrastructure specialists to provide an understanding of CI risk. 
  Information is produced that supports the response to emergent threats or immediate 
incidents, as well as strategic planning activities focuse
d on enhancing the protection of CI 
over the long term.
   2021 CI Support Annex, Pg. 
206
  CI risk assessment and analysis is a collaborative effort between ADEM, support agencies to this 
annex and other security partners to perform the following:
  Examine existing plans and infrastructure c
haracteristics to assess projected or actual 
impacts on CI in potential incident areas or on CI that have been designated as high risk.
  Determine critical failure points within or across CI sectors, State cascading effects and 
other significant issues that
 could affect CI assets inside and outside the immediate incident 
area.
 These assessments and analyses support CI protection and mitigation actions prior to an 
incident and timely response actions during an incident. Results of assessments and analyses are
 provided to State government decision
-makers, ESFs, emergency managers, CI owners and operators 
and appropriate local level government entities.
 Response Actions
 CI situational awareness and reporting are essential to providing a consolidated current 
oper
ating picture (COP) during an incident. 
  The Arkansas State Fusion Center provides coordinated CI status and infrastructure
-related 
information supporting the COP by serving as the State collection, reporting and distribution 
point for CI
-related informati
on.  
  The Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) is a partnership between the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, other Federal agencies, State and local law enforcement and specialized 
agencies, such as railroad police that are charged with taking action against 
terrorism, which 
includes the investigation of crimes such as wire fraud and identity theft. If a CI asset is 
involved during a terrorism incident or investigation, JTTF information can be shared on a 
need to know basis. 
 Requests for State assistance from
 CI owners and operators typically will be acted upon by 
ADEM and/or multiagency coordination centers in the affected area, such as the State or local EOC. CI 
owners and operators of public infrastructure in the affected area are required to follow the est
ablished 
application process for Stafford Act disaster assistance.
 CI
-related requests for incident
-related assistance may come in through various paths at the 
local, State, regional or national level. Requests for assistance or information from CI owners 
and 
  2021 CI Support Annex, Pg. 
207
  operators may relate to a variety of incident
-related needs such as requirements for security, impact 
area access, fuel or accommodations for crews needed to perform critical repair work.
 Regardless of the entry point, requests are coordinated, tracked
, and channeled to the 
appropriate authorities and CI subject
-matter experts from the appropriate cooperating agencies for 
resolution and determination of the best course of action.
 Local and State officials, in most cases, determine the appropriate level 
at which to consider 
and/or coordinate support to ensure the most effective response to requests for assistance from 
private
-sector CI owners and operators. Local authorities may elect to fill valid requests using local 
resources. If local resources are no
t available, they may utilize mutual aid and assistance agreements to 
access additional resources.
  If all local resources are depleted, including those that can be acquired through mutual aid 
agreements, then local officials may forward the request to the 
State for action. The State 
may also elect to fill valid requests using its assets or request support from another State 
using the Emergency Management Assistance Compact or other pre
-established 
memorandums of understanding. If assistance is not available
 at the State level, officials 
may forward the request to the Federal level.
 Post response Actions
 As an incident is brought to closure, incident
-related activities transition back from response to 
normal operations. Concurrently, the after
-action report i
s prepared.
 After
-action reports are developed following an incident to detail operational successes, 
problems and key issues affecting management of the incident. After
-action reports include appropriate 
feedback from all State, local, nongovernmental and
 private
-sector partners
 participating in the 
incident.

213
  The State of Arkansas fully supports and participates in the 
National Infrastructure Protection 
Plan.
 The state™s protection strategies include actions to mitigate the overall risk to CI assets, systems, 
networks, functions, 
or their interconnecting links. In the context of the NIPP, this includes actions to 
deter the threat, mitigate vulnerabilities, or minimize the consequences associated with a terrorist 
attack or other incident.
 Arkansas approved and adopted its Protected 
Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) in April 2009.  The state™s Infrastructure Protection Gateway (IP Gateway) 
administrator works closely with the Department of Homeland Security Protective Security Advisor for 
the state to coordinate the Arkansas IP Gateway database.
 Through efforts of the Critical Infrastructure Protection Branch, the Arkansas Division of 
Emergency Management (ADEM) assists state and local jurisdictions in obtaining grant funding to be 
used for
 the enhancement of CI protection.  ADEM representatives actively participate in assistance with 
Port Security Grant Programs and Buffer Zone Protection Programs.
 An ADEM representative chairs the Arkansas Homeland Security Advisory Group. Other ADEM 
repre
sentatives sit on the group also. This group guides the Homeland Security Grant Program funding 
expenditures and makes recommendations to the Arkansas Homeland Security Executive Committee to 
ensure spending is in support of the states™ overall protection 
strategies and the NIPP.

  Introduction
  Purpose
 This 
annex provides financial management guidance for state agencies that respond to a 
Governor declared disaster. The DFA will ensure that funds are managed and that financial operations 
are conducted in accordance with established state policies, regulations,
 and standards.
  Policies
 The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration directs implementation of the Financial 
Management Support Annex.
 DFA provides fiscal services and logistic support when all other resources from other ESFs (and 
federal suppor
t when applicable) have been exhausted. DFA also provides contract management 
oversight to state agencies responding to Governor declared disasters. All of the above mentioned must 
comply with existing policies, regulations, standards and law.
 All deployin
g state resources remain under the control of their respective state departments or 
agencies.
  Planning Assumptions
 Local plans address financial management as it relates to state financial management.
 Emergency supplies and equipment will be made availabl
e from resources of local, state and 
volunteer agencies.  
 Local entities conduct all hazards planning in collaboration with their respective jurisdictions as 
part of their steady
-state preparedness activities.
 Local jurisdictions will seek emergency suppl
emental response and recovery funding when the 
funding resources within their jurisdiction have been exhausted.
      2021 Financial Management Support Annex, Pg. 
216
  State Response
 As outlined in the Basic Plan section of this Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency Management 
Plan (ARCEMP), local governments req
uesting assistance must have declared that a state of emergency 
exists in their jurisdiction, to be eligible for state assistance. A disaster shall be declared by executive 
order or proclamation. Requests for assistance may be submitted to the SEOC by a Co
unty Judge, 
Sheriff, or Mayor of an incorporated city. Requests may also be submitted through the County 
Emergency Management Coordinator or State Area Coordinator. Through this process, the Governor 
makes state government financial support available throu
gh DFA to support emergency response and 
recovery efforts during and following a disaster. A copy of the executive order or proclamation from the 
Governor shall be forwarded to DFA.
 DFA is a standalone agency. DFA will staff the SEOC during training exerci
ses and emergencies as 
requested by the Director, Arkansas Division of Emergency Management. Resources provided are readily 
available in DFA offices and provide a more rapid response to state needs in emergency situations. In 
the event of a total communica
tion failure DFA will identify a trained liaison that will represent DFA in 
the State Emergency Operations Center. 
  DFA™s responsibilities include but are not limited to:
 Providing a point of contact to monitor funding requirements and incident costs.
 Kno
wing how to pay for resources from agencies requesting assistance through the SEOC such 
as supplies, office space, office equipment, etc.
 Coordinating funding and documenting the furnishing of resources to local government(s) 
through the SEOC.
 Training and
 exercising response personnel and, when/where possible, utilizing trained 
personnel to meet resource needs such as equipment, materials, and other resources during an 
emergency.

218
  Introduction
  This annex outlines how Arkansas addresses six key activities that enhance disaster resilience 
and improve the state™s 
ability to prevent hazards and threats from becoming disasters.
 Prevention is defined in the National Response Framework (NRF) as actions to avoid an incident 
or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Protection is defined in 
Developing and Maint
aining 
Emergency Operations Plans, Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101
 as actions to reduce or 
eliminate a threat to people, property, and the environment. 
 Both prevention and protection involve actions to protect lives and property. They involve 
applying intelligence and other information to a range of activities that may include such 
countermeasures as deterrence operations; heightened inspections; improved surveillance and security 
operations; investigations to determine the full nature and sourc
e of the threat; public health and 
agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation, or quarantine; and, as 
appropriate, specific law enforcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting, interdicting, or 
disrupting illegal activi
ty and apprehending potential perpetrators and bringing them to justice.
  Policies
  A primary focus on response and recovery is an impractical and inefficient strategy for 
dealing with ongoing threats.
  Disaster resilience must become inherent to our culture
.  Assumptions
  Hazards will always exist, but they only become disasters if the communities they touch are 
unprepared to deal with them.
  We cannot avoid all hazards, but we can act to reduce their impacts.
    2021 Prevention and Protection Annex, Pg. 
219
  Concept of Operations
  Provide Hazard and Disaste
r Information Where and When It Is Needed
 To identify and anticipate the hazards that threaten communities, a mechanism for real
-time 
data collection and interpretation must be readily available to and usable by scientists, emergency 
managers, first respon
ders, citizens, and policy makers. Developing and improving observation tools is 
essential to provide pertinent, comprehensive, and timely information for planning and response.
 Arkansas collects data to increase understanding of the ways in which hazards 
evolve by 
monitoring manmade threats through its relationships with various federal, local and private sector 
partners including, but not limited to The Federal Bureau of Investigations, The Department of 
Homeland Security, county and municipal law enforce
ment agencies, private sector entities 
headquartered in Arkansas.
 Arkansas has standards in place for sharing, storing and analyzing data. The Arkansas State 
Fusion Center is the State™s information hub for all crimes, crime trends and manmade threats in t
he 
state.  The fusion center has a staff of data analysts that dissect and disseminate information to the 
appropriate stakeholders.  The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management has embedded two 
analysts at the fusion center.  These analysts are assigned 
to monitor the state™s critical infrastructure 
systems and assets.
  Understand the Processes That Produce Hazards
 Arkansas indirectly uses models and other tools to support an improved understanding of 
underlying natural system processes and enhance assess
ment of the impacts. Some examples are 
discussed in the following paragraphs.
 The Mid
-America Earthquake Center™s (MAE Center) report on the impact of New Madrid 
Seismic Zone Earthquakes on the Central USA is used extensively. (See 
https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/14810
  for the MAE Center data including a list of software 
and tools used by the MAE Center to develop the data.) Arkansas maintains a relationship with the 
National Wea
ther Service and uses the models and tools available on a number of websites to anticipate 
probable response needs.
 The Arkansas State Fusion Center (ASFC) uses models and tools to collect, integrate, and 
evaluate information that has an effect on detectin
g and preventing criminal or terrorist
-related activity. 
  2021 Prevention and Protection Annex, Pg. 
220
  Those will not be named here to avoid giving specific information to persons who would use it to cause 
harm.
 ADEM works closely with the FBI and the NGAR to produce the annual manmade threat 
assessme
nt for the State. The results of this assessment are used to guide the State™s protection efforts 
against current threats. ADEM continually sponsors training courses to broaden the understanding of 
intentional and unintentional manmade threats.  These cour
ses are (when appropriate) made available 
to both public and private sector partners to enhance stakeholders understanding of these threats and 
concepts to prevent and mitigate any manmade disaster incident.
  Develop Hazard Mitigation Strategies and Techno
logies
 To prevent or reduce damage from natural hazards, communities must implement affordable 
and effective hazard mitigation strategies, including land
-use planning and zoning laws that recognize 
the risks of natural hazards. In addition, technologies su
ch as disaster
-resilient design and materials 
should be used for development in hazardous areas. By designing and building structures and 
infrastructures that are inherently hazard resistant, communities can greatly reduce their vulnerability.
 The Arkansas
 Building Code is based on the International Fire, Building, and Residential Codes, 
with some Arkansas changes. The Code applies statewide, including rural and unincorporated areas.
 Arkansas™ Floodplain Administrator Accreditation Program assures that pers
ons responsible for 
important economic decisions affecting the health, safety, and welfare of the state receive annual 
training to assist them in managing development in floodplains.
 Effective disaster mitigation requires the ability to quantify an action™
s monetary benefits using 
economic modeling. A cost benefit analysis is performed on every mitigation project before it can be 
submitted for approval. A determination is made that proposed preventive ventures are cost effective 
before resources are committ
ed to those actions. 
  Recognize and Reduce Vulnerability of Interdependent Critical Infrastructure
 Protecting critical infrastructure systems, or lifelines, is essential to developing disaster
-resilient 
communities. To be successful, scientists and commun
ities must identify and address the 
interdependencies of these lifelines at a systems level (e.g., communications, electricity, financial, gas, 
sewage, transportation, and water). Using integrated models of interdependent systems, additional 
vulnerabilitie
s can be identified and then addressed. Protecting critical infrastructure provides a solid 
foundation from which the community can respond to hazards rapidly and effectively.
   2021 Prevention and Protection Annex, Pg. 
221
  Arkansas has relationships with science and technology partners to prevent casca
ding failures in 
public infrastructure systems. This occurs partly through ADEM™s involvement with the Arkansas 
Water/Wastewater Agency Response Network (ARWARN) and InfraGard. ARWARN is organized to 
support and promote statewide emergency preparedness, di
saster response, and mutual assistance for 
utility systems in Arkansas. InfraGard is an association of businesses, academic institutions, state and 
local law enforcement agencies and other participants dedicated to sharing information and intelligence 
to p
revent hostile acts against the United States. InfraGard Chapters are geographically linked with FBI 
Field Office territories. 
 The state also reaches out to public utility partners to involve them with exercise and training 
opportunities and conducts risk
 and vulnerability assessments at utility facilities across the state.
 To enhance the ability to protect public health before and after a hazard event, Arkansas™ ESF #8 
reduces the vulnerability of medical infrastructure by planning and exercising to coord
inate the 
furnishing of health and medical services and resources from unaffected areas to augment or replace 
local capabilities that are disrupted or destroyed.
  Assess Disaster Resilience Using Standard Methods
  Formal standards and metrics have not been
 identified for comprehensively assessing disaster 
resilience for Arkansas or the jurisdictions within the state. However, Arkansas is continuously working 
with all stakeholders to increase capabilities in every discipline and jurisdiction. Arkansas suppor
ts 
intelligent community planning and investment strategies and protects natural resources with 
comprehensive risk assessments. 
 Arkansas is diligent in after action reporting for each hazard event. Information collected results 
in lessons learned and shar
ed with other jurisdictions. Efforts to eliminate shortfalls revealed by hazard 
events and exercises continually increase resiliency across the state.
      2021 Prevention and Protection Annex, Pg. 
222
  Promote Risk
-Wise Behavior 
  To be effective, hazard information (e.g., forecasts and warnings) must b
e communicated to a 
population that understands and trusts the messages. The at
-risk population must then respond 
appropriately to the information. The state™s public information professionals, collectively and 
individually, are diligent in assuring that a
ccurate, timely information is released through the various 
media outlets to build public trust over time.
 Arkansas raises public awareness of local hazards by working through local media outlets to 
convey pre
-disaster messages. Arkansas provides informati
on as requested through its agencies and 
partners with predictive capabilities, such as the National Weather Service and the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, and with subject matter expertise, such as the Arkansas Department of Health.
 Arkansas warns its citi
zens with consistent, accessible, and actionable messages. During an 
incident a state core group develops, coordinates, and delivers information and instructions. The 
objectives of this group are 1) Delivery of incident preparedness, health, response, and 
recovery 
instructions to those directly affected by the incident and 2) Dissemination of incident information to 
the general public. Further information can be found in the Public Affairs Support Annex of the ARCEMP.
 Programs have been developed to promote
 risk
-wise behavior. The Fusion Center public 
outreach program includes education on recognizing suspicious behaviors and how to report those 
behaviors.

   Introduction
 The Logistics Management Support Annex to the Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency 
Management Plan (ARCEMP) p
rovides an overview of the framework through which the overall logistics 
management function operates and describes how State resources fit into this framework. This annex 
provides an overview of logistics management functions, roles, and responsibilities.
 This annex also 
provides a concept of operations for logistics management in support of the National Response 
Framework (NRF) and describes how the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) 
coordinates logistics management with the Federal Emergenc
y Management Agency (FEMA), other 
State agencies, local governments and the private sector.
 Policies
 The logistics management function for State response is a component of Emergency Support 
Function (ESF) #5 
- Emergency Management and ESF #7 
- Resource Sup
port. The Logistics Section of the 
State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) primarily handles logistics management responsibilities. The 
SEOC Team Chief will prioritize resource allocation in accordance with priorities outlined in the Arkansas 
SEOC Plan.
   2021 Logistics Management Support Annex 
224
  The SEOC Logistics section will coordinate and document the provision of resources to local and 
State government and will track those resources to the completion of disaster use. Resources may 
include specialized equipment, personnel, expertise, etc., and r
outine supplies that are beyond the 
means of local governments.
 Material Management.
 Logistics personnel find appropriate, time
-sensitive, and cost
-effective 
ways to fill the material requirements developed by operations personnel or local governments. Exi
sting 
support agencies™ resources and local sources outside the impacted area will serve as the primary source 
of equipment, supplies, and personnel. When these sources cannot provide support, logistics personnel 
will request federal resources, EMAC member
 state resources, or commercially available resources.
 Personal Property Management.
 Each State agency maintains internal resource lists. Arkansas 
Division of Emergency Management curates the resource lists from all agencies to monitor availability 
during 
an incident. All deploying State resources remain under the control of their respective State 
department or agency during mobilization and deployment.
 Facility Management.
 The following ESFs support occupation of all facilities and related support 
necessar
y for operations:
  ESF #7
- Resource Support supports the requirements for procuring facility setup, 
space management, building services, and general facility operations.
  ESF #3
- Public Works and Engineering provides operational support for 
mobilization cent
ers, staging areas, and distribution sites for all infrastructure 
and engineering service commodities (supplies and equipment) required to 
support assigned missions. Support agencies would possibly be contacted for 
consultation. 
  ESF #2
- Communications sup
ports emergency telecommunications and 
information technology services for State incident managers.
  ESF #8
- Public Health and Medical Services supports public health and medical 
services for State incident managers.
 Transportation Management. 
ESF #1 
- Tran
sportation can provide transportation assistance for 
materials within the State when providers/requestors are unable to provide commodity transportation. 
ESF #1, in coordination with the SEOC, can also assist in determining the mode and carrier for all

. Concept of Operations
 Logistical Response Operations
 The structure of the State logistics operation depends on logistics partners that provide 
resources
 to support emergency/disaster operations. Resource support provides for prevention, 
preparedness, response, and recovery actions during all phases of incident management. Effective 
logistics management contributes to mission success and ensures a unified 
and coordinated execution 
of all functions. This will reduce costs, ensure appropriate support actions, and increase response 
capability. 
  Initial Actions.
  Operations staff will alert interagency logistics providers and select logistics teams for 
the SEOC
 if deemed necessary.
  Logistics personnel assigned to the SEOC perform the following functions:
 o Track resources in WebEOC.
 o Analyze requests for State resources to determine available, cost
-effective, and timely 
means to meet requirements.
 o Participate with 
operations and planning to coordinate meetings and maintain 
situational awareness.
 Ongoing Actions.
  SEOC logistics personnel continuously perform logistics management activities.  
  SEOC Logistics Section roles and responsibilities focus on providing and co
ordinating 
delivery of required resources to sustain operations.  
  When local, State, and volunteer resources are inadequate to fulfill the requests, the 
EMAC on
-call team will request assistance from member states. Once the State receives 
a presidential d
eclaration for disaster, the State will request federal assistance.
   2021 Logistics Management Support Annex 
226
  Demobilization.
  As response operations begin to diminish, Incident Commanders release state agencies 
from their respective operations.
  If the ADEM Duty Officers need assistance to monitor 
and manage resources that 
remain in the field after the SEOC steps down from Level 1, the Logistics Section may 
remain active. Tasks that may be necessary after staff has officially been released from 
the SEOC include the following:
 o Coordinate and conduct 
activities associated with retrieving, refurbishing, and 
restocking State and local assets used during emergency/disaster operations.
 o Coordinate disposal of resources that are no longer serviceable.
 o Account for all equipment and supplies in accordance with
 appropriate regulations.
 o Track resources through to completion and mark resource requests ‚Closed™ in 
WebEOC.
  State resource logistics partners begin preparation activities in anticipation of the next 
event; identifying shortfalls and developing correctiv
e action plans.
  Resource Fulfillment Cycle
 This section of the annex addresses the overall methodology used to anticipate and 
subsequently fulfill requirements of victims during emergencies/disasters. The degree, scope, and 
anticipated duration of each di
saster dictates the State logistics response to it.
 Process.
 The ordering, sourcing, transportation, issuing, and movement of State resources 
generally follow the procedural steps outlined:
  The local jurisdiction attempts to meet its own needs from existin
g resources. If 
it cannot fill the need, it issues an emergency declaration and uses intrastate 
mutual aid to fill the need or submits a request to the SEOC. The request must 
include, but is not limited to, the number of items needed, the location they 
sho
uld be delivered to, the point of contact at that location, and the time that 
the jurisdiction anticipates the return of the item (if applicable). 
  When the SEOC receives the request, logistics personnel will determine the 
availability of resources and the
 Team Chief will prioritize requests. The State will 
  2021 Logistics Management Support Annex 
227
  attempt to fill all approved requests through several means: using existing 
resources, through commercial sources, or through the Emergency Management 
Assistance Compact (EMAC).  
  Once the resource is lo
cated, SEOC staff will coordinate transportation to the 
delivery address.
  If applicable, SEOC staff will coordinate with the entity making the request to 
determine the time and date of return for requested items.
  Responsibilities
 The ESFs have responsibil
ity for locating and managing resources through the SEOC in 
coordination with ADEM. Arkansas DFA, in its role as ESF #7 Lead Coordinating agency, will handle 
resource requests that require procurement. ADEM will oversee the process.

 Introduction
  Purpose 
 This Public Affairs Support Annex describes the interagency p
olicies and procedures used to 
rapidly mobilize State assets to prepare and deliver coordinated and sustained messages to the public in 
response to incidents requiring
 a coordinated State response. 
 Scope
 This annex provides guidance for the coordinating a
gency and other ESF #15 participating 
agencies in an incident requiring the activation of ESF #15
- External Affairs.  This annex outlines the 
equipment/personnel utilized, procedures and responsibilities of those responding to the incident.  
 This document
 is integrated with and supported through the ESF #15 
resource management 
structure. 
 Policies
 The National Incident Management System (NIMS) institutes an integrated concept, termed 
ﬁincident communications,ﬂ as the approach used to manage communications 
with the public during 
incidents requiring a coordinated State response. Incident communications incorporates the following 
processes:
  Control: 
Identification of incident communications, primary and supporting department and 
agency roles, and authorities f
or release of information. 
  Coordination: 
Specification of interagency coordination and plans, notification, activation, 
and supporting protocols.
  Communications: 
Development of accessible message content such as incident facts, health 
risk concerns, pre
-incident and post
-incident preparedness recommendations, warning 
issues, incident information, messages, audiences, and strategies for when, where, how, and 
by whom the messages will be delivered. 
     2021 
Public Affairs Annex
, 
Pg. 
230
 General guidance on the authority to release information 
is in accordance with existing plans, 
operational security, law enforcement protocols, designated coordinating and primary agency 
assignments, and current procedures. Nothing in this annex limits the authority of State and local 
authorities to release info
rmation regarding an incident under their jurisdiction, particularly if it involves 
immediate health and safety issues.
 Local authorities retain the primary responsibility for communicating health and safety 
instructions for their population. 
 Integration 
and teamwork among Federal, State, and local authorities is essential. Local
 authorities are encouraged to contact Arkansas Division of Emergency Management Public Affairs 
(ADEM PA) as they release initial or follow
-on information. ADEM PA engages with loc
al and affected 
private
-sector counterparts as soon as possible during an actual or potential incident to synchronize 
overall incident communications to the public. 
 Concept of Operations 
 General 
 During an incident, Federal, State, and local authorities 
share responsibility for communicating 
information regarding the incident to the public. These actions are a critical component of incident 
management and must be fully integrated with all other operational actions to ensure the following 
objectives are me
t: 
  Delivery of incident preparedness, health, response, recovery, and other pertinent 
instructions to those directly affected by the incident. 
  Dissemination of incident information to the general public. 
 The Joint Information Center (JIC) structure prov
ides a supporting mechanism to develop, 
coordinate, and deliver messages. It supports the Incident Commander or Unified Command and the 
associated elements of the Incident Command System (ICS).
     2021 
Public Affairs Annex

 A State core group develops, coordinates, and delivers infor
mation and instructions to the 
public related to:
  State assistance to the incident
-affected area. 
  State departmental/agency response. 
  State preparations. 
  Protective measures. 
  State law enforcement activities. 
  Assignments to this core group are determ
ined by ADEM PA in accordance with jurisdictional 
and statutory responsibilities, operational tasks, areas of expertise and responsibility, and the nature 
and location of the incident. 
 The ADEM PA has primary responsibility for coordinating the State inci
dent communications 
effort by: 
  Providing leadership during domestic incidents when interagency coordination is required. 
  Identifying State department and interagency participants and arranging conference calls 
and other activities necessary for coordinat
ion of public information.
  Establishing a strategic communications flow during an incident requiring a coordinated 
State response. 
  Designating a public affairs team to staff the JIC, comprised of external affairs officials from 
various state government de
partments and agencies. 
  Providing coordination with the Homeland Security Council (HSC) and other entities within 
the Executive Office of the President on matters related to dissemination of incident
-related 
information to the public. 
  Communications Tea
m  The State Government operates as a team to ensure successful incident communications with 
the public. From initial notifications to final recovery actions, the State team must operate and speak 
with a unified voice and consistent message that is coordin
ated not only with the different State 
authorities involved in an incident, but also with affected local authorities. This is done as described in 
  2021 
Public Affairs Annex
, 
Pg. 
232
 the Emergency Support Function #15 Annex to the Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency Management 
Plan (ARCEMP).
 The organizational approach for public affairs and incident communications with the public 
relies on the following organizations and positions: 
  Public Affairs Coordination Team:  
The coordination team is designed to facilitate the flow of 
information, but i
n no way inhibits information from other agencies.  They serve as a 
steering committee for overall operation of public affairs.  The team is comprised of PIOs 
from each support function that staffs the SEOC during operation as well as other possible 
key ag
encies. 
  Joint Information Center: 
A JIC is a central point to facilitate operation of the Joint 
Information System (JIS) during and after an incident.  Here all incident
-related public 
information activities are coordinated.  It is the central point of co
ntact for all news media.  
The JIC may be established at an on
-scene location in coordination with State and local 
agencies depending on the requirements of the incident. In most cases, the JIC is established 
at or is virtually connected to the Joint Field
 Office (JFO), under the coordination of ADEM 
PA. However, the most important consideration concerning location will be the proximity to 
the incident.
  Incident JIC: 
An Incident JIC is a physical location in the affected area where public 
information profes
sionals from organizations involved in incident management activities can 
co-locate to perform critical emergency information, crisis communications, and public 
affairs functions.
  Virtual JIC: 
A virtual JIC links all participants through technological mean
s when geographical 
restrictions, incident management requirements, and other limitations preclude physical 
attendance by public affairs leadership at a central location. Virtual JICs continue as long as 
the situation warrants and are an effective alternat
ive to physical collocation of public 
affairs assets. 
  Satellite JIC: 
The Satellite JIC is a forward
-deployed component of an Incident JIC. Smaller in 
scale, a Satellite JIC is established to provide a scalable and flexible capability for timely 
release of
 information, as the incident situation evolves. A Satellite JIC may be established to 
support a specific press event. 
   2021 
Public Affairs Annex

233
  Public Affairs Officer: 
Public Affairs provides the Public Affairs Officer to the JFO Unified 
Coordination Staff during an incident requ
iring a coordinated Federal response. The Public 
Affairs Officer serves as the primary external affairs advisor to the State Coordinating Officer 
(SCO).
 Specific duties include coordinating and developing the external affairs and communications 
strategy; c
oordinating the external affairs information flow within the JFO and among other Federal, 
State, and local counterparts; and facilitating site visits by governmental officials, foreign dignitaries, and 
other VIPs. 
 Other public affairs personnel can includ
e the Public Affairs Deputy and Executive Officers, a 
Press Secretary, a Principal Federal Official (PFO) liaison, and Assistant External Affairs Officers for 
Congressional Affairs, Local Affairs, the Private Sector, Community Relations, and Planning and P
roducts.  
All positions within public affairs are on an as needed basis depending upon the incident.  Positions 
staffed will be deter
mined by the Coordination Team.

  Introduction
 Policies 
 Local governments have the primary responsibility to develop and implement plans to manage 
volunteer services and donated goods. 
 Donations. 
The Volunteer & Donations Manage
ment Team, will work together with ARVOAD to 
manage donated goods. State and local governments may lead the coordination of the donations 
operations.  It is not the state's intent to alter, divert or otherwise impede the normal operation or flow 
of goods o
r services through volunteer organizations, but to help coordinate offers of donated goods 
and services.  State and local government will encourage all donations be made directly to recognized 
nonprofit organizations that are normally active in disasters.
 Full use of existing local voluntary donations management resources is encouraged before state 
assets are requested. The state primarily works with those voluntary organizations with established 
donation structures already in place to receive and deliver a
ppropriate donated goods to disaster 
victims.

  Volunteers. 
ESF #6 will activate the Volunteer and Donations Management Annex when 
  an event causes a spontaneous flow of volunteers and/or donated resources, 
  the local resources have been exhausted, 
  there 
is a major need for volunteers and/or donated resources, 
  assistance is requested by the local government.
  Entities accepting spontaneous volunteers are responsible for the care and management of 
those volunteers. All volunteers must be screened by the vo
luntary organizations that will be using their 
services and/or by an agency such as Volunteers of America or Points of Light Foundation.
 The Volunteer & Donations Management Team will work actively with member agencies to set 
up a Volunteer Reception Cente
r (VRC) to direct spontaneous or unaffiliated volunteers to the areas 
they are needed. All volunteers will be responsible for their own food and lodging.  They will be treated 
with dignity and respect for the value of the work they contribute to the respon
se and recovery effort. 
  Pre
-incident Activities 
 The state will encourage individuals interested in volunteering personal services to directly 
affiliate with a voluntary organization/agency of their choice or register at a local volunteer reception 
cente
r. The State encourages donations from the general public to be made as cash to voluntary, faith
-based, and/or community organizations providing services to disaster victims.

  Worker Safety and Health Support Annex
  Coordinating Agency
 Arkansas Department of Labor and Licensing/Arkansas Occupational Safety and Health (ADLL/AOSH)
  Introduction
 Policies 
 Private
-sector, State, and local employers have the responsibility to ensure the safety and health 
of their employees. This annex ensures that assistance is available to meet those responsibilities.
 ADLL/AOSH assistance in the Worker Safety and He
alth Support Annex may also be requested 
by Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) or individual agencies during an incident. 
 Safety and health issues and tasks are prioritized in cooperation with State and/or local 
governments and in coordination with the St
ate Coordinating Officer. 
 Several State agencies, including ADLL/AOSH, have oversight authority for response and 
recovery workers and response operations. While these agencies retain their authorities, they are 
expected to work cooperatively and proactive
ly with Federal, State, local, and private
-sector response 
and recovery workers to ensure the adequate protection of those workers. 
 This annex provides State support when an incident overwhelms local capabilities 
 and/or when other State departments or ag
encies require assistance.
 This annex includes planning and preparation to ensure the health and safety of response and 
recovery workers. It provides a consistent approach to the protection of these workers before and 
during a State response to an incident
.    2021 Worker Safety and Health Support Annex, Pg. 
246
  Concept of Operations
 General 
 ADLL/AOSH coordinates occupational safety and health assets to be provided to State and local 
response and recovery workers to support the overall response and recovery operations. ADLL/AOSH 
coordinates among agencies, St
ate and local governments, and private
-sector organizations involved in 
incident response; provides proactive consideration of all potential hazards; ensures management of all 
safety resources needed by responders and recovery workers; and shares responder
 and recovery 
worker risk assessment and risk management information. 
 As the coordinator for the Worker Safety and Health Support Annex ADLL/ AOSH facilitates 
resolution of any technical or other disputes involving worker safety and health. In the case of
 a dispute 
that cannot be resolved, ADOL/AOSH will summarize the disputed areas for presentation to the Incident 
Command Post (ICP) Safety Officer (for site
-specific issues), the Interagency Worker Safety and Health 
Coordinating Committee at the Joint Fiel
d Office (JFO) (including representatives from State 
Organizations), the Unified Coordination Group, and/or the Director of Labor for resolution. 
  Organization
 Headquarters level.
 ADLL/AOSH coordinates the activities of the State agencies that provide 
res
ponse and recovery worker safety and health technical support during incidents requiring a 
coordinated State response.
 Regional and field levels.
 ADLL/AOSH and cooperating agencies provide staff to support the 
JFO. The JFO Safety Coordinator and the repres
entatives of ADLL/AOSH and other cooperating agencies 
make up the safety function on the Unified Coordination Staff. Additionally, these representatives may 
serve as technical specialists in other JFO elements as required. 
 ADOL/AOSH Office helps provide s
ituational awareness necessary for the mitigation of 
responder and recovery worker risk reduction prior to and following an incident. If the ADLL/AOSH 
Office is represented in the JFO, it serves on the JFO™s Interagency Safety and Health Committee, which 
coordinates the worker safety and health program among the various agencies.
 When activated, this annex determines potential needs for worker safety and health support. 
Staff from this annex participate on emergency response teams as requested.
   2021 Worker Safety and Health Support Annex, Pg.

  Pre
-incident
 Coordination
 The Arkansas ADLL provides coordination of the Worker Safety and Health Support Annex 
cooperative agencies. The Worker Safety and Health Support Coordination Committee provides the 
integration of response and recovery worker safety and health
 assets needed for preparedness at all 
levels of government. 
 ADLL/AOSH works with other worker safety and health organizations to: 
  Consolidate and distribute response and recovery worker safety and health
-related 
guidance documents, regulations, and reso
urces. 
  Develop and fund response and recovery worker training to ensure the training curricula are 
consistent in content and message for each level of responder and recovery worker (skilled 
support, operations level, etc.) and that they support the prepar
edness objectives listed in 
the National Incident Management System. 
  Develop and disseminate an inventory of worker safety and health expertise and resources 
available for AOSH to use in its response to incidents requiring coordination, and coordinate 
dev
elopment of a strategy for their deployment. 
  Develop and disseminate information on the likely hazards associated with potential 
incidents, and the preventive actions that can be taken to reduce or eliminate illnesses and 
injuries that may result from the
se hazards.

  ANNEX N
 RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION SYSTEM 
 I.  PURPOSE 
 The purpose of this Annex is to provide the necessary planning for protecting public health and 
safety in a release, spill, th
eft, or other incidents, which have occurred during the storage, 
transportation, or use of radioactive materials; from an act of nuclear terrorism; or, from a nuclear 
catastrophe. 
 NOTE: This Annex 
does not
 provide response procedures for a radiological in
cident at 
Arkansas Nuclear One (ANO).  See ANNEX V, ARKANSAS NUCLEAR ONE. 
 II.
 ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES 
 The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) is the responsible State agency for overseeing all 
technical radiological protection pl
anning and operational activities. 
 The ADH Radiation Control Section has trained personnel (including an on
-call response team), 
and required instrumentation necessary for conducting advanced level radiological protection 
operations in the event of a radi
ological emergency or nuclear catastrophe. 
 III.
 ANNEX DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE 
 Staff members of the ADH™s Radiation Control Section and the Public Health Preparedness Branch 
have developed this annex and its associated appendices. These documents will
 be reviewed 
annually and revised as necessary.  The recommendations from periodic exercise critiques, as well 
as actual incident After
-Action Reports, will be the basis for future Annex revisions. 
 IV.
  SITUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS
  A. 
 SITUATION 
 Any jurisd
iction in Arkansas is subject to a radiological incident that could potentially 
expose its inhabitants to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.  Such an incident might 
result from: 
 1. An accident involving a highway vehicle, train, plane or commercia
l vessel, which is 
transporting radioactive material. 
  2. A release or spill at a facility or site using radioactive material for commercial, 
industrial, or medical purposes. 
   2021 Annex N Radiological Response, Pg. 
252
   3.  A loss or spread of radioactive material as a secondary effect of a theft
, explosion, 
fire or natural disaster.
   4.

 An act of terrorism where a Radioactive Dispersal Device (RDD) or an Improvised 
Nuclear Device (IND) has b
een detonated.
   6. 
 A nuclear weapon has been detonated. 
  B. 
 ASSUMPTIONS
 1. Most county governments, through their appropriate emergency service 
organizations, have a ""First Response"" capability for initially dealing with a 
radiological incident.  Howev
er, these organizations do not have the trained 
personnel and/or technical instrumentation required for advanced radiological 
monitoring, assessment, and clean
-up operations.
 2. 
 The ADH Radiation Control Section has a trained and equipped Radiological 
Res
ponse Team (RRT) on
-call and available to respond to radiological incidents.
 3. 
 This team, supported by other state agencies, will provide off
-site advice and/or 
will conduct on
-site operations required to resolve the incident, as well as 
providing respon
sible officials with the advice necessary to protect the public 
health. The Radiation Control Section will oversee all clean

   III. ORGANIZATION
   A.
 GENERAL
   The Arkansas system of emergency management is a comprehensive system that addresses 
the five phases of mitigat
ion, prevent, protect, response, and recovery. Emergency services 
in Arkansas are structured around government. For the purposes of this radiological 
emergency response plan, the following definitions shall apply:
   1. STATE ORGANIZATION shall mean state gove
rnment, with the principal 
organizations for radiological emergency 
preparedness 
and response being the   
ADH and ADEM, both of which maintain a 24
-hours
-per
-day emergency response 
capability,
 including
 24-hours
-per
-day
 manned
 communication
 links.
 ADH
 is the lead 
in the
 Joint
 Information
 Center
 (JIC)
 for
 Radiological
 incidents.
   2. SUB
-ORGANIZATIONS are those state agencies 
and 
volunteer organizations having 
support responsibilities. The response efforts of these sub
-organizations are 
coordinated by ADEM. The
 concept of emergency operations for the sub
- organizations is specified 
in 
the appropriate Annexes to the ARCEMP. The sub
- organizations have assigned Emergency Management Liaison Officers (EMLOs)  
who
 can
 be
 contacted
 24-hours
 per
 day
 by ADEM.
   3. PRINCIPA
L LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS shall mean the county governments of EPZ and 
IPZ Counties. Each entity maintains a 24
- hours
-per
-day emergency response, 
including 24
-hours
-per
-day staffed communication
 links.
   2021 Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
277
  B.
 LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT
   1. The Arkansas Emergency Services Act r
equires that 
the 
Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) 
of political sub
-divisions be responsible for emergency preparedness within their 
political jurisdictions. In consultation with the 
ADEM 
Director, each CEO is authorized to 
appoint a coordinator of emergency
 services to administer the jurisdiction's emergency 
preparedness
 program.
  2. Five counties within the state have Radiological Emergency Response Plans in place,     
to be implemented in the event of a radiological incident at ANO. Included are Johnson, 
Loga
n, Pope, and Yell Counties. Each of these four counties is partially within 
the 
inhalation exposure pathway (10
-mile EPZ). Conway County provides reception and care 
centers for Pope County evacuees. These are additional plans, and not annexes of the 
county
 EOP's. Additionally, there are 14 counties within the 50
-mile Ingestion
 Pathway.
   3. The
 county
 judges,
 CEOs,
 in each
 of
 the
 five
 counties
 have
 appointed
 emergency
 service 
coordinators
 to administer
 their
 emergency
 preparedness
 programs.
   4. Local radiologica
l emergency response organizations and the specific concepts of 
operations are outlined in the Radiological Emergency Response Plans for Conway, 
Johnson, Logan, Pope, and Yell
 Counties.

 operations
 are
 the
 prerogative
 of
 the
 federal
 government
 and
 should
 be 
included in the Radiation Emergency Response Plans of the individual agencies. 
They
 are
 therefore
 not
 delineated
 in this
 Annex.
  3. A limited amount of 
space 
will be provided at the State Emergency Operations 
Facility (SEOF) for allocation by FEMA 
to 
representatives of federal agencies in the 
event
 that
 they
 are
 called
 upon
 to 
respond
 to 
a radiological
 incident.
  4. If the
 Preside
nt
 of
 the
 United
 States
 declares
 an emergency
 or
 if there
 is a major 
disaster relating 
to 
a radiological incident at a fixed nuclear facility in Arkansas, 
FEMA, through the NRF, may ask any federal agency for whatever assistance is 
deemed
 necessary.
   IV. ON-SITE EMERGENCY
 RESPONSIBILITY
  On-site radiological emergency planning for the ANO facility is the responsibility of 
Entergy 
Operations, Inc. That organization's responsibilities and implementation of emergency 
procedures are detailed in the ANO Emergency P
lan. Letters and/or memoranda of agreement 
between
 Entergy
 Operations,
 Inc.
 and
 off
-site
 response
 agencies
 are
 discussed
 in the
 appropriate 
sections of that
 document.
  2021 
Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
283
    V. LOCAL GOVERNMENT
 RESPONSIBILITY
   A.
 The County Judges, or CEO's, have ultimate authority o
ver emergency management in their 
respective
 jurisdictions.
 The
 CEO's
 have
 ensured
 that
 local
 Radiological
 Emergency
 Response
 Plans are 
in place for Johnson, Logan, Pope, and Yell Counties, 
as 
these four counties are in the 10
-mile EPZ; 
and in Conway Count
y, which is a designated host county for evacuees 
from 
the 10
- mile EPZ.  IPZ 
only counties have specific procedures in Chapter 12. Specific responsibilities are contained in each 
Plan. The Nuclear Planning & Response Program (NP&RP) of  the  ADH  Emergenc
y  provides 
assistance 
to  
local government officials  in preparing radiological emergency response support 
plans.
   B.
 The
 following
 concepts
 apply
 to each
 of
 the
 five
 aforementioned
 EPZ
 county
 governments:
   1. General
:  Local governments are prepared to provi
de citizens of the affected area within 
their jurisdiction with directives in order to minimize adverse health effects, 
including a plan of action for an orderly response.
   2. Notification
:   (a)
 The
 means
 for
 immediate
 notification
 of
 the
 population
-at-risk
 wit
hin
 the
 10- mile inhalation EPZ is specified in each of the aforementioned county's 
Radiological
 Emergency
 Response
 Plan.
 In addition,
 notification
 of
 the
 public 
is also
 addressed
 in Chapters
 4 and
 5 of
 Annex
 V.   (b)
 Local governments may 
be 
notified of the o
ccurrence of a radiological 
incident by either the ADH or
 ANO.
   (c)
 Upon notification that a radiological incident has occurred or is imminent, 
local governments will implement their Radiological 
Emergency 
Response 
Plans  to  the  degree  consistent  with  th
e magnitude  of  the
 incident.
  2021 
Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
284
    3. Immediate
 Actions
:  Local governments may take actions necessary to limit the consequences of the 
incident, as recommended by the Technical Operations Control Director (TOCD), in 
accordance with local plans and procedures. S
uch actions might include:
   (a)
 Evacuation,
 remain
 indoors,
 or
 sheltering
 people
 from
 the
 affected
 areas, 
which
 may
 include
 some
 institutionalized
 or
 otherwise
 infirmed
 persons.
  (b)
 Provisions for emergency first aid and arrangements for medical assistance 
from 
the nearest available medical
 facility.
  (c)
 Restriction of unnecessary movement of personnel into the affected 
area.
  (d)
 Discontinuing
 the
 use
 of
 contaminated
 food
 and
 water
 supplies.
   VI. STATE GOVERNMENT
 RESPONSIBILITIES
  The ultimate responsibility for the welfa
re of the citizens and continuity of the government of the 
State of Arkansas rests with the Governor. Under the emergency management system of the 
State
 of
 Arkansas,
 as authorized
 by
 the
 Arkansas
 Emergency
 Services
 Act
 and
 the
 ARCEMP
 (which
 is 
published by
 directive of the Governor), each emergency function  assigned  to  state  and 
volunteer agencies requires that some agencies assume primary responsibility for accomplishing a 
particular task. In each instance, one or more state agencies are assigned suppo
rting roles 
in  
order
 to provide
 specialized
 assistance
 to the
 primary
 agency.
  In keeping with the federal regulations and guidelines for radiological emergency response plans in 
support of fixed nuclear facilities, the  responsibilities  of  principal  o
rganizations  for  off
-site 
planning and preparedness in support of ANO are shared between two agencies:
   A.
 ARKANSAS
 DIVISION
 OF EMERGENCY
 MANAGEMENT
  1. Director of the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM), 
the 
designated liaison 
between 
the state
 and FEMA, has primary responsibility for 
management
 of
 the
 ADEM,
 operation
 of
 the
 State
 Emergency
 Operations
 Center 
(EOC),
 and
 the
 request
 for
 and
 coordination
 of:
  2021 
Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
285
    (a)
 All
 logistical
 support
 operations
 among
 state
 and
 volunteer
 agencies.
   (b)
 Non
-technical fede
ral assistance.
   2. OPERATION
  ADEM is operated on a 24

    VII. FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT
  A.
 Disaster assistance 
from 
agencies of the federal
 government 
is authorized 
under  
the 
provisions
 of
 applicable
 federal
 laws,
 as specified
 in the
 ARCEMP.
 It is to be
 requested
 by
 the Director of ADEM or an authorized representative. Federal assistance 
is 
supplementary to, and not a substitute for, relief 
afforded 
by 
the state and local 
governments. Specific information
 regarding
 federal
 disaster
 assistance
 may
 be obtained
 from
 ADEM.
  B.
 Off
-site radiological monitoring and assessment assistance under the NRF, will 
be requested 
by 
the 
TOCD 
or an authorized
 rep
resentative.
  VIII.
 CONCEPT OF
 OPERATION
  A.
 RADIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY
 CONCEPTS
  1. GENERAL
  Radiological incident response planning for Arkansas is based on the principle    
that local authorities bear the initial responsibility for logistical support 
activities in copi
ng
 with
 emergencies,
 and
 that
 relief
 will
 be
 requested
 from
 the
 next
 higher
 level of
 government
 only
 after
 resources
 at the
 local
 level
 prove
 to be inadequate.
  2. TECHNICAL
 OPERATIONS
  a. Local governments have minimal capability to monitor, measure, and 
assess
 radiological contamination of the type likely 
to 
occur in peacetime 
radiological incidents. Neither do they have the capability to evaluate the 
biological and environmental
 effects
 of
 such
 an incident.
  b.
 The RC and EM Sections of the ADH possess the equipm
ent and 
expertise to perform the above
-mentioned functions. Therefore, 
responsibility for such monitoring, measurement, assessment, and 
evaluation rests with the
 ADH.
  c. The operator of ANO will provide basic technical information to the ADH 
concerning poten
tial or actual release of radionucli
des from the facility. 
ADH will
 in turn, provide
 radiological
 incident
 information
 to ADEM.
  d.
 The SEOF will be activated to the extent necessary, depending on 
 2021 Annex V ANO Radiological 
Emergency Response, Pg. 
289
    the magnitude of the
 situation.
  e. Based upon evaluation of 
the 
situation, the TOCD will provide responsible 
local government
 officials
 with
 advisories,
 and
 any
 necessary
 instructions
 as to actions required 
to 
protect the public
 health.
 SUPPORT & LOGISTIC
 OPERATIONS
 f. Upon
 notification
 by
 the
 ADH
 of
 a radiological
 incide
nt
 at ANO,
 ADEM
 will
 activate the 
SEOC 
to  
the extent  necessary  
to  
provide  off
-site  logistic 
support
 services.
 ADEM will notify liaison officers for state agencies and 
volunteer organizations.
 Depending
 on
 the
 nature
 and
 severity
 of
 the
 incident,
 the
 EMLO will either report 
to 
the SEOC, or maintain telecommunication 
contact with ADEM
 in order
 to provide
 support
 as necessary.
  B.
 DECLARED
 EMERGENCY
  1. The Governor of Arkansas may declare an emergency to exist within the state, or any 
portion
 thereof,
 wheneve
r in his
 opinion
 the
 safety of
 the
 state
 requires
 the
 exercising 
of extreme emergency measures, and when local resources are insufficient 
to 
cope 
with
 the
 effects
 of
 an emergency
 situation.

   EMERGENCY RESPONSE SUPPORT & 
RESOURCES
  I. FEDERAL
 ASSISTANCE
  As stated in Chapter 1, Part VII, disaster assistance by agenci
es of the federal government is 
authorized under provisions of the NRF. Such assistance is requested by the Director of 
ADEM, or  an au
thorized representative. Federal off
-site radiological monitoring and 
assessment assistance is requested 
by 
the TOCD, or an authorized rep
resentative. Federal 
assistance
 is supplementary to, and
 not
 a substitute
 for,
 relief
 afforded
 by
 the
 state
 and
 local
 governments.
  A.
 In the event that a radiological incident at ANO exceeds the technical capability of 
state resources
 for
 adequate
 assessment,
 federal
 assistance
 may
 be required
 through
 the
 NRF.
 The Nuclear/Radiological Incident (NRI) Annex lists the types of
 support 
available and from which
 federal
 agencies
 the
 support
 will
 be
 provided.
  B.
 The
 TOCD
 may
 request
 monitoring
 and
 assessment
 assistance
 from
 the
 DOE
 through
 the NRF. The expected time of arrival for assistance would be from 18 to 
48 hours from the time
 of
 the
 initial
 request,
 depending
 on
 the
 type
 of
 assistance
 requested.
 This
 assistance 
may include, but is not limited
 to:
  1. Health physics
 personnel.
  2. Radiochemistry
 personnel.
  3. Collection and analysis
 equipment.
  4. Portable whole
-body
 counting.
  5. Dose proje
ction and
 assessment.
   C.
 Concepts of operation are the prerogative of the various agencies of the 
federal government,
 which
 are defined
 in the
 NRF.
  D.
 Operations space and a telephone line will 
be 
provided for a Dept. of Homeland 
Security (DHS)
 liaison
 at the
 state's
 primary
 SEOF.
 A limited
 amount
 of
 space
 and
 a limited
 number
 of telephone lines may be provided at the backup SEOF that DHS 
may requisition as a command post for representatives of federal agencies in the 
event they are called upon to respond to a
 radiological incident. An airfield is 
available 
within one mile of the field team staging area and 
backup
 SEOF.

 SEOF
  The TOCD may elect to 
use 
the ADH EOC as an alternate location as the situation 
dictates, involving
 pro
jected
 short
-term
 events
 when
 it would
 not
 be able
 to reach
 the
 SEOF
 before the
 event
 termination;
 when
 travel
 conditions
 preclude
 reaching
 the
 SEOF;
 when
 response to
 the
 SEOF
 might
 subject
 RRTL
 to transiting
 the
 plume;
 other
 situations
 as required.
 In the
se events, elements from NP&RP may staff the SEOF or the Alternative SEOF.
  B.
 SEOC
  Depending
 upon
 the
 nature
 and
 severity
 of
 a given
 emergency
 situation,
 the

  EMERGENCY CLASSIFICATION
 SYSTEM
  I. GENERAL
  A.
 An Emergency Classification and Action Level scheme is in use by the operator of 
ANO, which includes facility system and effluent parameters set forth in NUREG
-0654, FEMA
- REP
-1, Rev.
 1, Appendix
 1. This
 system
 is detailed
 in the
 ANO
 Emer
gency
 Plan,
 Section
 D., ""Emergency Classification
 System.""
  B.
 The
 state
 and
 local
 emergency
 classification
 system
 is consistent
 with
 the
 ANO
 system.
  C.
 As required by NUREG
-654, FEMA
-REP
-1, Rev.1, four classes of emergency are 
established:
  1. Notification of Unu
sual
 Event
  2. Alert
  3. Site Area
 Emergency
  4. General
 Emergency
  D.
 The system would normally develop sequentially. Gradation is provided to ensure 
adequate emergency management preparations for more serious indicators.  The 
rationale behind  the  ""Notification of 
Unusual  Event""  and ""Alert""  classes  is to  provide 
prompt notification of relatively minor events which could lead 
to 
more serious 
consequences, given operator error
 or
 equipment
 failure,
 or
 which
 might
 be
 indicative
 of
 more
 serious
 conditions
 which
 are not yet 
fully
 realized.
  E. The SEOF is activated at 
the 
""Alert"" Emergency Classification (EC), or at a higher level, 
should
 the
 higher
 level
 be declared
 without
 first
 declaring
 ""Alert.""
 At
 the
 direction
 of
 the TOCD,
 it may
 also 
be activated
 prior
 to an ""Ale
rt""
 EC declaration.
  F. Notification
 methods
 and
 procedures
 are discussed
 in Chapter
 4.  G.
 Methods and procedures for emergency actions to be taken at the state 
and 
local 
levels are addressed
 and/or
 referenced
 in Chapters
 5 through
 14 of
 this
 Annex.
  H. Agricultur
e PAAs will be considered during all phases of the event. If 
Agriculture PAAs cannot be issued for areas before a release occurs or 
PAAs are issued 
to 
the public for evacuation, sheltering, or remaining 
indoors, agricultural products in these areas will be
 quarantined.

COMMUNICATIONS
 I. OFFICIAL
 NOTIFICATION
  A.
 Prior to the full activation of the
 SEOF
  The ADH ECC is the official 24
-hours
-per
-day point of contact between the State of 
Arkansas and ANO for the initial notificat
ion of a radiological incident, and for any 
other communication prior to the activation of the SE
OF. Contacts are authenticated.
  1. Under normal conditions, primary contact with the state and county 
warning points is via the InForm System, as illustrated in 
Figure 5.1. The 
alternate commercial (unsecured) telephone or the AWIN radio is 
illustrated in Figure
 5.2.
  2. Once an 
EC 
notification 
has 
been received from ANO, the ADH Radiological 
Response 
Team 
(RRT) Staff Duty Officers (SDOs) are notified using the 
metho
ds outlined in the Emergency Communications Center (ECC) standard 
operating procedures.
  3. If an 
ALERT 
or a higher
- l e v e l EC is declared, or if the TOCD or an 
authorized representative should
 request, then:
  a. The
 ECC
 will
 activate
 the
 ADH
 emergency
 respon
se organization
 according
 to established
 protocol.
  b.
 The
 SEOC
 will
 activate
 according
 to established
 protocol.
   II. Full
 activation
 of
 the
 SEOF
 occurs
 when
 the
 designated
 TOCD
 has
 arrived
 at the
 SEOF
 or
 when the LGL makes the determination and assumes 
command 
and control of technical 
operations for the state until the TOCD arrives. The SEOF becomes the 
primary 
point of 
contact between ANO and the state only after it has been declared fully activated or 
operational by the TOCD or LGL. All Emergency Classificatio
ns (ECs) 
and
 other
 communications from ANO will then be directed to the SEOF. Technical 
operational control of all offsite response actions will be provided from this 
facility. The alternate SEOF has the same communication capability.
  1. The ADH and ANO will
 be officially notified that all information is to be 
passed directly from ANO to the SEOF. This is illustrated in Figure
 5.3.
  2. The
 SEOF
 will
 be
 responsible
 for
 passing
 all information

    CHAPTER 6
  PUBLIC EDUCATION & INFORMATION
 I. GENERAL
  Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) in Arkansas consists of the four phases of 
compreh
ensive emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. As 
an integral component of REP, the primary objectives of the public education and information 
system are to provide:
  A.
 Pre
-incident 
mitigation 
and 
preparedness 
programs for edu
cating and 
informing all segments of the public within the ANO
 EPZ.
  B.
 Programs for keeping the public informed during the response and recovery 
phases of a radiological
 incident.
  II. PRE
-INCIDENT EDUCATION &
 INFORMATION
  A.
 Ten-Mile
 Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ)
  The public will be periodically provided with information including specifics 
detailing: 
1) how they will receive notification of a radiological incident; and 2) 
how 
they should 
react to such an incident. The methods for meeting t
his objective will includ
e, but
 not 
be limited to the
 following.
  1. An 
Emergency Instruction Booklet 
(EIB), which will be updated and 
annually mailed to each household within the 10
-mile EPZ. The EIB will
 contain:
  a. Information on the nature of radiation and on protective measures su
ch as 
evacuation routes and 
procedures, location of
 designated care centers, and 
sheltering.
 b.
 Where specifically to request additional information.
 c. A postage
-prepaid, 
detachable  
postcard is provided for use by persons   
who may have special 
needs, 
such as 
for out
-of
-the
-ordinary notification or 
transportation requirements. This 
form 
is to be mailed to the ADH NP&RP 
office. The information is to 
be 
subsequently provided to the appropriate 
local
 government.
 d.
 Information contained in the EIB is also posted and/
or placed in those 
recreation and other areas within the 10
-mile EPZ, which are routinely 
visited by transient population (persons vacationing in, or passing through, 
the
 area).
 e. It is the policy of the state to not recommend radioprotective drugs or 
respir
atory protection for the general public. Therefore, information on 
 2021 Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Respon
se, Pg. 
309
    such is not included in the EIB. Radioprotective drugs are discussed in 
Chapter 9 of ANNEX V.
   2. Special  education  programs  for  public  and  private  schools  are  conducted annually. 
The programs include details of procedures used to protect the public; procedures to be 
followed by students during an emergency situation, whether the student is in, or away 
from, school; and the locations and functions of the designated care 
 centers.
  3. Edu
cation and information programs are offered annually to area civic and service 
organizations. These programs include information on the Emergency Warning System 
(EWS),
 evacuation
 routes,
 and
 designated
 care
 centers.
  4. An annual media workshop is conducted t
o provide pre
-incident information to the 
news media. This includes information pertaining to the nature of
 radiation,
 specific radiological emergency plans, points of contact, and where media 
representatives may report in the e
vent of an emergency situati
on.
  B.
 The 50
-Mile
 IPZ
  A pamphlet providing information 
to 
the agricultural population within the 50
-mile 
IPZ 
has 
been produced. This pamphlet contains information on the nature of radiation, protective 
actions for dairy cattle and other livestock, methods 
for dealing with milk and other 
substances in the food chain, and the U.S. EPA guidelines for dealing with protective action 
levels. Printed and digital pdf copies of 
this 
pamphlet 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
the 
19 
county 
extension
 offices
 with
-in
 the
 50
-mile
 IPZ
 for
 distribution
 when
 a radiological
 release
 event,
 which 
may
 affect
 the
 agricultural
 community,
 has
 been
 verified.
  2021 Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Respon
se, Pg. 
310
    III. INFORMATION
 DURING 
THE 
RESPONSE/RECOVERY PHASES
  The Public Education & Information System during an emergency, including the response a
nd 
recovery/re
-entry phases, is divided into two areas.
  A.
 The information that is transmitted over NOAA Weather Radio and information 
transmitted
 over
 local
 broadcast
 stations
 within
 the
 10-mile
 EPZ.
  B.
 The information that is provided to the news media by th
e state's Public Information     
Team (PIT), which is the official contact point between the state and local governments, and 
the news media during radiological incidents. PIT operations are outlined in ""Procedures   
for Emergency  Activation and  Operatio
n of  the Public  Information Team
 (PIT).""
  1. PIT
 activities
 will
 occur
 primarily
 at the
 EOF
 in conjunction
 with
 ANO
 Media
 Center 
operations.
  2. The PIT will prepare and disseminate information to the news media 
representatives
 who
 are present
 at the
 Media
 Cen
ter.
  3. All
 information
 will
 be
 approved
 by
 the
 TOCD
 before
 it is released
 by the
 PIT.
  4. Periodic news conferences will be conducted in order to inform the media 
representatives of state actions and the current incident response statue. News 
conferences may b
e conducted as necessary 
to 
update 
media representatives 
whenever a new PAA is issued, or a change has occurred in the 
emergency 
classification level
 (ECL).
  5. The state PIT will 
coordinate 
its activities with the 
ANO 
Media
 Team.
   a. When appropriate, the 
ANO 
and State of Arkansas spokespersons will 
appear
 together
 at the
 news
 conferences.
   b.
 The State may 
also 
conduct news conferences without direct participation 
by ANO
 representatives.
  2021 Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Respon
se, Pg. 
311
    IV. RUMOR
 CONTROL
   In any emergency, the possibility exists for the spread of
 misinformation and rumors 
among the news media and the general public, as well as throughout the various levels of 
the emergency response organization. The following protocol has been developed to 
control the spread of rumors and misinformation.
   A.
 For pur
poses of rumor control, the JIC is considered to be the official point of contact for 
the news media. Annual training provided to media representatives will stress that 
information received from outside the media center should be verified. The NP&RP 
teleph
one lines described hereinafter  may  also  be accessed by  the media for updates 
on the situation.
  B.
 The telephone numbers for NP&RP are listed in all emergency information publications. 
Toll
-free TDD telephone numbers for the deaf and hearing impaired are
 also included in 
the listings.
   1. Inquiries
 are answered
 as expeditiously
 as possible.
  2. Any information that is doubtful will be verified.
  3. State and local government officials are informed that questions should be 
directed to the SEOF.
   C.
 Rumor control for
 the general public is considered a 
joint 
venture between the 
state 
and 
the utility.
 Although
 rumor
 control
 centers
 on
 providing
 timely
 information
 through
 the
 EBS
 and
 the news
 media,
 it is recognized
 that
 other
 methods
 may
 be
 employed
 to answer
 the
 concer
ns
 of
 the public during times of
 emergency.
   1. It is anticipated
 that
 many
 calls
 from
 the
 general
 public
 and
 others
 may
 be
 made
 directly to the utility. If the situation warrants, the utility will operate a rumor 
control phone bank, which will work in conce
rt with 
the 
state PIT and others to 
provide information in as timely a manner as
 possible.
  2. Inquiry types and substance are periodically analyzed to assess possible rumor 
trends, and to determine whether news releases should be issued to address 
specific i
ssues of concern.
  D.
 All emergency workers are cautioned during training sessions that any doubtful 
information should be verified.

  I. GENERAL
  A.
 Management
  The management object
ive of a radiological incident is to minimize the detrimental 
effects of the incident on persons and property. To accomplish this, the capability to 
measure and assess the impact of a radiological incident is needed. The Accident 
Assessment Group of the RR
T possesses the necessary capabilities.
  B.

 the
 ADH
 field
 teams
 will
 be
 deployed
 to track 
and define plume parameters, as described hereinafter. Whole  body  dose 
projections are made using terminal links to t
he ANO Radiological Dose Assessment 
Computer 
System 
(RDACS) site
-specific dose projection model. RASCAL dose 
assessment
 model

  2021 Annex V ANO Radiological 
Emergency Response, Pg. 
317
    II. FIELD
 MEASUREMENT
  A.
 Fission
 Products
  To support the recommendation of protective action for persons and property
, 
specific parameters must be measured. Those of primary interest involve gaseous 
fission products. The measurement of these requires plume location and tracking. 
The parameters are as follows:
  1. Radioiodine
  a. Radioiodine
 concentrations
 in the
 plume
 will
 be determined
 by taking
 air samples with portable samplers on fiber filter and 
silver zeolite cartridges.
  b.
 These samples may first be evaluated at or near, the sample site 
by 
use 
of a NaI probe and a portable survey meter. The lower limit of 
detection in the 
field, under any weather condition, is at least 1E
-7 micro curies per cubic centimeter. Procedures  to  ensure  Noble  
gases  
and  background readings do not reduce this detection limit 
are found in the Radiation Control Procedures.
  c. If further analysis is
 necessary, samples will be transported 
to the Radiochemistry
 Laboratory,
 ADH,
 in Little
 Rock,
 Arkansas.
  2. Ambient Radiation
 Reading
  This reading will be determined by using the following:
  a. Direct Radiation Measurements: Expected radiation field intensitie
s will be measured
 with
 the
 following
 survey
 meters,
 or
 the
 equivalent:
  (1)
 Ludlum, Model 19, micro
-R meter, 0 to 5,000 uR/hr.
 (2)
 Ludlum, Model 3, with GM sidewall, Model 44
-66 
probe, 
0.01 
to 
200
 mR/hr.
 (3)
 Ludlum Model 2241
-3. 0 to 100
 R/hr.
  b.
 Thermoluminescent Dosi
meters (TLDs): Threshold 0.1 mR integrated 
exposure.
       2021 Annex V ANO Radiological 
Emergency Response, Pg. 
318
    B.
 Environmental
 Sampling
  1. Environmental indicators of radiological hazards through liquid or gaseous 
release pathways
 to be 
sampled
 include,
 but
 are not
 limited
 to:
  a. Water
 samples
 will
 be
 collected
 at the
 following
 locations:
  (1)
 ANO Unit 1, discharge canal, at the exclusion
 boundary.
  (2)
 The Arkansas
 River.
  (3)
 Other streams, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, wells, and 
private 
water supplies,
 as deemed
 necessary
 by
 the
 TOCD
 or
 the
 RRTL.
  b.
 Soil samples will  be  collec
ted  where  appropriate  in  areas  where 
deposition of radionuclides may have occurred, for determination of 
milk
-chain and other ingestion pathway protective action requirements, 
and for ground shine exposure
 levels.
  c. Vegetation samples will 
be 
collected
 where appropriate  in  the  areas 
where
 deposition
 of
 radionuclides
 may
 have
 occurred
 for
 determination
 of milk
-chain and other ingestion pathway protective 
action requirements, and for 
ground 
shine exposure
 levels.
  2. Environmental sampling is expected 
to 
continue for a considerable time into
 the post
-accident
 period.
 As
 a result,
 environmental
 data
 will
 provide
 both
 information for decisions regarding protective actions, and a 
basis for total
- impact assessment.
  3. All samples may undergo analytical screenin
g prior to being sent to the 
Radiochemistry Lab at the ADH in Little Rock, for more definitive analysis. As 
stated in Chapter 2, the capabilities and detection limits are adequate to 
support emergency response and routine environmental surveillance 
functio
ns, as evidenced by EPA certification of this lab. In all cases, controls 
will be collected and analyzed.
  4. Sample collection, receipt, transportation, analysis, and reporting 
procedures are described in the FIELD TEAM OPERATIONS PROCEDURES 
MANUAL. and Radi
ation Control Procedures

    III. ASSESSMENT OF 
FIELD
 DATA
   A.
 Responsibility for Accident
 Assessment
   1. All field monitoring data will be received by the Accident Assessment Group 
at the SEOF.
  2. The use of field data for the assessment of radiological hazards will 
be the 
responsibility of the TOCD via the Radiological Response Team Leader (RRTL). 
All data received will be analyzed as rapidly as possible, to assess the 
magnitude of release and the locations of populations affected through the 
various
 pathways.
  3. The c
oncept of protective actions guides and protective actions to be used 
are those found in the U.S. EPA MANUAL OF PROTECTIVE ACTIONS GUIDES 
AND PROTECTIVE ACTIONS FOR NUCLEAR
 INCIDENTS.

Plans. The potential risks of implementing a given protective action will be considered 
against the reduction of radiological risk to be achieved by that protective action. Optional 
advisor
ies that may be issued by the TOCD are:
  2021 Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 321
   1. Evacuation
  a. Advisory:
 If evacuation has been determined to  be  the  appropriate  protective 
measure, the state will advise that it 
be 
carried out according 
to 
zones that 
have been established to correspond with lan
dmarks, which are easily 
recognizable,
 both
 to the
 public
 and
 to the
 agencies
 responsible
 for
 carrying
 out 
the evacuation. Evacuation may be advised when:
  It h
as been determined by the TOCD or an authorized 
representative that, 
based on plant conditions, 
the situation is sufficiently volatile to threaten the 
public health and safety.
  b.
 Implementation: The ordering and enforcement of an evacuation is the 
responsibility
 of

    A.
 Ingestion Exposure
 Pathway
  Protective response may be nece
ssary in the 50
-mile EPZ. The protective action guideline is to 
restrict the dose commitment for the whole body, bone marrow, or any other organ. The action 
levels and procedures for protective response are those found in the ADH Protective Action 
Guidelin
es. Other possible actions will be considered on a case
-by
-case basis. This issue is more 
fully addressed in Chapter 12.
  1. Pasture
 Lands
  a. The
 recommended
 protective
 action
 where
 pasturelands
 are affected
 by
 passage 
of the plume 
is 
removal of lactating dairy
 herds from contaminated pasturage, 
and placement on uncontaminated stored
 feed.
  b.
 The USDA will
 via the NRF, provide the ADH with information concerning the 
location of growing crops, grains, forage, etc., so that samples may be taken to 
determine if there
 is a hazard to humans or
 animals.
 c. If the ADH declares a particular area quarantined for cattle grazing, the USDA 
will provide farmers with information concerning the availability of 
uncontaminated feed. Requests for this information can be made through 
AD
EM.
 2. Water
  If a water sample analysis indicates levels of radionuclides above specified limits, the 
protective action advised by the TOCD and ordered by the ADH will be to transport 
uncontaminated drinking water (potable) from other locations.
  3. Milk
  Sampl
es will be taken from dairy and milk pro
ducers in the affected area to 
determine if 
contamination is present.
  a. Contaminated milk will be withheld from the market 
to allow for the decay  of 
short
-lived radionuclides. This may be achieved
 by:
  (1)
 Freezing
 and
 storage
 of
 milk,
 concentrated
 milk,
 or
 milk
 products.
  (2)
 Storage for prolonged periods at reduced temperatures, provided that 
ultra
-high temperature pasteurization has been applied during processing.
  b.
 Fluid milk may be diverted to the production of dry whole 
milk, nonfat dry 
milk,
 butter,
 evaporated
 milk,
 or
 other
 milk
 products.

 out
 these
 protective
 actions
 will
 be
 provided
 by ADH 
and the U.S.
 FDA.
  4. Fruits and
 Vegetables
  If sample analyses indicate contamination of fruits and vegetab
les, the following protective 
actions will be taken:
  a. Washing,
 brushing,
 scrubbing,
 or
 peeling
 to remove
 surface 
contamination.
  b.
 Storage to permit decay of short
-lived radionuclides, or preservation by 
canning, freezing, or
 dehydration.
  5. Grains
  If sample
 analyses
 indicate
 contamination
 of
 grains,
 the
 recommended
 protective
 action
 is 
milling and
 polishing.
  6. Meat and
 Fish
  If sample analyses ind
icate contamination of meat or fish, the 
following protective 
action will be recommended: Withholding products from
 the market to allow for decay 
of short
-lived radionuclides. This may be achieved by storage of frozen products, or by 
other types of processing such as smoking and curing.
   III. SAMPLING LOCATIONS: Monitoring sites for RRT field teams are pre
-designated; howe
ver, 
samples may be taken at other sites if deemed appropriate. Air samples may also be taken at 
these
 sites.

     Chapter 12
   Ingestion Pathway Zone (IPZ) and Population Relocation 
Control of Foodstuffs and Contamination Control
 There are all or parts of 19 Arkansas counties within a 50
-mile radius of Arkansas Nuclear 
One (ANO) a
s shown in Figure 12.1 and Figure 12.2.
  Persons in counties outside the ten
-mile radius (EPZ) of ANO, are unlikely to be exposed 
to direct radiation from a plume containing radioactive isotopes. However, there is a 
possibility that those counties in the 0
-to-50-mile radius, also known as the Ingestion 
Pathway Zone (IPZ), could be subjected to radioactive deposition on to exposed surfaces, 
including area lakes, bodies of water, and edible foodstuffs.
  Contamination of groundcover could result in uptake of r
adiation by foraging of livestock 
and wildlife.
  This deposition could also affect row crops, orchards, and gardens. Surface sources of 
human and animal drinking water could also be contaminated. Radioactive deposition 
could also affect other non
-edible su
bstances which would adversely impact their 
usability and/or marketability and pose the danger of spreading contamination. These 
include but are not limited to; timber and minerals (strip mines and quarries).
  A survey of counties with areas inside the IPZ
 has identified potential items that would 
require attention in the event that a radioactive plume transverses all or part of a 
particular county.
  In the event of a release of radioactive material from ANO, the Arkansas Department of 
Health (ADH), which h
as lead statutory authority, will review the composition, both 
isotopically and chemically, of the release. ADH will project the probable direction of 
travel of the plume containing radioactive material and the likelihood such material will 
be carried outs
ide the 10
-mile EPZ. ADH will then notify the affected counties of the 
possibility that the plum will or has traversed their area.
  Notification will be accomplished by contacting the affected county Warning Points by 
means shown in Attachment 12
-A. Upon n
otification, the County Warning Point will 
notify key officials of the need to respond to the County Emergency Operations Center 
(EOC) or specially designated command and control facility.
    2021 Annex V ANO 
Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
333
     ADH will also notify other affected state agencies as noted, inc
luding the Department of 
Emergency Management, Secretary of Agriculture, and Arkansas Game and Fish 
Commission. ADH will also notify key staff in the agency™s Public Water, Public Food, and 
Communication Branches.  ADH will also notify the agency™s veterin
arian.
  The secretary of Agriculture will provide support from the State Plant Board, the State 
Poultry and Livestock Commission, the Arkansas Forestry Commission, and the State 
Apiary Board.
  ADH will activate the Alternate State Emergency Operations Faci
lity, where agencies will 
meet to establish a conference call with affected counties, as well as Federal Agencies.
  Projected plume plots will be provided to each affected county for use in formulating 
measures to protect the public from ingestion of radio
active material which has or is 
expected to be deposited on ground cover or surface water sources.
  PRE
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  The TOCD may elect to issue pre
-deposition PAA™s to minimize the potential effect of 
radioactive material on some products. Initial
 actions prior to radiation monitoring and 
sampling, may include:
  Edible Food Products:
  1. Placing livestock and poultry on stored feed and preventing the ingestion 
of surface
 water
  2. Restriction of human consumption of exposed food products
 without 
proper p
reparation,
 Including:
 a. Fruits
  b.
 Garden
 Vegetables
  c. Fresh poultry and other meat products including beef, swine, and 
fish
  3. Temporally embargoing all food and agricultural products until 
monitoring
  4. Halting intake of surface water into community water systems
 and 
operating on stored water
 only
  5. Recommending no garden vegetables be
 harvested
     2021 Annex V ANO 
Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
334
    POST
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
   Following confirmation of the presence of radioactive deposition, in consultation with 
local, state, and federal authorities, recommendations 
may be made to embargo various 
products, along with instructions to the public regarding the use of garden vegetables and 
other agricultural products.  Additional actions may include:
   1. Washing, defoliating, husking, diversion, or destruction of edible foo
d and 
agricultural products, such as soybeans, corn, wheat, rice, apples, 
peaches, and other exposed
 crops.
  2. Limiting potable water to that which was in storage tanks prior to the 
event.
  3. Washing and peeling of garden
 produce.
  4. Destruction or diversion of 
livestock and poultry and wildlife which may 
have ingested contaminated food or
 water.
  5. Embargo of all fish and wildlife harvested in the impacted
 area.
  6. Embargo, diversion or destruction of honey and other related
 products.
  There are products which may b
ecome contaminated which are not for human or food 
chain consumption. However, in order to avoid spread of contamination, protective 
actions may be required.
  NON
-EDIBLE PRODUCTS
:  Timber, and geological products will be evaluated and suggestions regarding
 their 
use and safety with regard to contamination, will be considered, including:
  1. Natural washing through precipitation, debarking or diversion of 
marketable
 timber.
  2. Washing of marketable gravel and other minerals to prevent the 
spread of radioactive
 contamination.
  3. In the event of leaching into bark, diversion of Christmas Tree 
farm production may be
 required.
      2021 Annex V ANO 
Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
335
    FOOD CHAIN CONSIDERATIONS
:  Hay, grain crops for agricultural feed, ground cover used for foraging, and water used by 
poultry or livestock wi
ll be evaluated to determine its usability.
   EMBARGO CONSIDERATIONS
:  The Arkansas Department of Agriculture will assist in the recommendation and 
enforcement of embargo measures.
  Law enforcement agencies will assist with the enforcement of the embargo o
f crops and 
livestock and to prevent their transportation outside the area.
  LIMITATION OF HUNTING AND FISHING
:  The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission will be consulted in reference to limiting or 
halting the taking of edible fish and game from affected ar
eas. The agency may consider 
banning hunting and fishing in certain areas until wildlife can be assessed for 
contamination
.  DESTRUCTION OF CROPS, DIARY PRODUCTS, LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY
:  The Arkansas Department of Health, the Secretary of Agriculture, and 
the Arkansas 
Department of Environmental Quality will review acceptable methods for the destruction 
and disposal of Agricultural products, including, but not limited to, row crops, fruits, 
vegetables, milk and dairy products, honey, livestock, and poultry,
 where their processing 
or consumption is determined to pose a risk to public health and safety. Guidance and 
assistance maybe enlisted from Federal partners, including the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency.
  PUBLIC INF
ORMATION
:  ADH will formulate news releases defining areas affected, precautionary measures, 
embargo, and possible decontamination instructions.
  News releases will also address any restrictions on hunting and/or fishing and information 
on where to request
 additional information.
  Information as to where and how to apply for assistance or how to file claims for 
economic loss will be provided.

    IPZ COUNTY PLANS
:  Of the 19 counties impacted by the 50
-mile IPZ, five counties have independent, 
individual Rad
iological Emergency Response Plans, due to the fact that they are either 
within the 10
-mile Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) or serve as a host county for evacuees. 
Those are show in Figure 12.1 on the following page.

    RELOCATION
:   There is a slight chance that areas, either inside the EPZ or outside a 10
-mile radius of 
ANO, could have human popu
lations which could be adversely impacted by radioactive 
deposition. The most common cause of this would be due to micro
-meteorological 
events, such as heavy rain which could ﬁwashoutﬂ higher concentrations of radiation over 
a confined area. These areas wo
uld be identified during the sampling phase of an event, 
most likely after the emergency phase has ended. If such concentrations exceed EPA 
Protective Action Guides (PAG™s), the TOCD would issue a PAA for the area, which would 
need the County Judge to conc
ur. The most likely action would be relocation, or 
evacuation of the population until
 PAG™s were no longer exceeded.

    BEYOND DESIGN BASIS EXTERNAL EVENTS
  L DISCUSSION:
  In a
ddition to planned emergency response actions based on design basis accidents, Arkansas 
Nuclear One (ANO) is required to respond to Beyond Design Basis External Events (BDBEE) which 
cause extended loss of all AC power (ELAP) for greater than one hour and l
oss of access to the 
ultimate heat sink which is Lake Dardanelle. In order to respond to these conditions (caused by a 
beyond design basis earthquake or direct tornado strike on site with significant damage), the 
nuclear industry has developed a program kn
own as FLEX. This program provides additional 
installed equipment in the plant (Phase I), backup equipment such as pumps and generators stored 
in seismic and tornado resistant buildings located on the owner
-controlled property (Phase II), and 
larger and mo
re specialized equipment stored in centralized facilities in Memphis and Phoenix 
(Phase III).
  II. PLANNING:
  The planning for a BDBEE event assumes that the ANO site is cut off for the first 6 hours after the 
event due to road/bridge damage, downed power line
s, and debris. ANO Shift personnel will 
implement the Phase I and Phase II strategies without support from the outside to maintain the 
plant in a stable configuration for an indefinite period of time. For planning purposes, most 
communications systems in a
 25-mile radius around ANO are considered to be damaged and 
unavailable forcing the use of Satellite phones. Planning also assumes that after the first six hours, 
members of the ANO Emergency Response Organization (ERO) teams will begin to arrive in small 
groups and staff the Emergency Response Facilities over an extended period of time. This is different 
from the normal 60
-90 minutes for a design basis event response and may require Arkansas 
Department of Health and Arkansas Division of Emergency Managemen
t representatives to work 
from the Little Rock State Emergency Operations Facility (SEOF) or from the State EOC at Camp 
Robinson since they may not be able to reach the ANO Emergency Operations Facility (EOF). It is 
likely that the alternate ANO EOF at 305
 South Knoxville, Russellville will be activated if it is more 
accessible. This scenario assumes that the event, whether a direct tornado strike on ANO or major 
seismic event is centered around ANO and not a major event elsewhere in the state such as a 
cat
astrophic New Madrid Fault earthquake
. Implementation of the Flex III strategy to get equipment 
from the National SAFER Response Centers in Memphis or Phoenix will help restore onsit
e AC 
power, ensure long
-term protection of the nuclear cores,
 and ultimate
ly protect the public. The 
following is a list of the types of support that may be requested from Local, County and State 
governments to implement the Phase III Strategy. The list is provided to help Local, County and State 
Governments anticipate potential
 requests and is thorough but not 
all-inclusive

APPENDIX
 Appendix 12
-1 Crawford County
 SITUATION
:  Persons in areas outside of about a ten
-mile radius of a commercial nuclear power station are not expected to 
receive direct exposure to ionizing 
radiation. However, there could be adverse consequences from deposition 
from an airborne plume containing radioactive material onto ground surfaces in an area out to about 50 miles, 
referred to as the Ingestion Pathway Zone (IPZ).
  Crawford County is locat
ed in a generally northwesterly direction from Arkansas Nuclear One (ANO), starting  
at approximately 46.8 miles (Attachment Crawford A). While the entire county is not in the IPZ, 
 approximately
 26.8
 square
 miles
 or
 17,169
 acres
 of
 the
 county
 are included
 in the ANO
 IPZ
 (Attachment
 Crawford
 B).
  A summary of potential agricultural products and activities, as well as other products and 
activities, which could 
be affected by radioactive ground deposition,
 is shown in Attachment Crawford C to this appendix, 
List o
f Agricultural and Other Products Pote
ntially Affected by Deposition.
  PURPOSE
:  The purpose of this Appendix is to delineate the 
procedures, which
 Crawford County officials will follow 
in responding to a deposition of radioactive material from ANO in the 
county.
  NOTIFICATION AND ACTIVATION
:  The Crawford County Warning Point (WP), located at the County 911 Center, will receive notification of a 
radioactive release with a potential impact on Crawford County from the State as outlined in Attachment A of 
Ann
ex V, Chapter 12.
  If received via an unsecured system, such as commercial telephone, the WP will authenticate the notification 
message by an approved method and will then alert key county officials as detailed in Attachme
nt Crawford D 
to this appendix.
 2021 Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Respo
nse, Pg. 
357
    Up
on notification, Key Officials (see Attachment Crawford E), at a minimum, the County Judge, County 
Emergency Management Director, and the County Agriculture Agent, or their designee, will report to the 
Crawford County EOC; located at 1820 Chestnut Street, 
Van Buren, Arkansas.
  Key County Officials will initially follow the steps described in the IPZ EOC 
Activation Checklist 
(Attachment 
Crawford F).
  The State will establish contact with the Crawford County EOC via commercial telephone, or an alternate 
means
 such as AWIN radio. This initial contact will layout procedures for; establishing a conference call 
between the State and affected county(ies); method for receiving plume plot and projected deposition maps; 
and for coordinating information for official ne
ws releases.
  Key County Officials will review the list of potential exposure to radioactive ground deposition as cont
ained in 
Attachment Crawford C.
  PRE
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS
:  The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) Technical Operations Control Director (T
OCD) may elect to issue 
pre
-deposition Protective Action Advisories (PAAs) to minimize the potential effects of radioactive material on 
some products.  These include:
   Placing livestock and/or poultry on stored feed and
 water.
   Covering outdoor sources of 
animal feed, such as, covering hay
 bales.
   Covering outdoor sources of water for animals, such as, troughs and
 tanks.
   Other preventative measures, as
 appropriate.
   The temporary embargo of foodstuffs, including livestock, poultry, and crops for 
human or a
nimal
 consumption.
   In the event a PAA is issued for areas including Crawford County, the County Judge will review the PAA and 
concur in its implementation as appropriate.
  Determining areas of actual deposition and level of contamination will be the resp
onsibility of the State, with 
assistance of Federal agencies, including the EPA.
  2021 Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Respo
nse, Pg. 
358
     POST
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  Once the area of deposition and the level and type of radioisotopes have been determined, the State, in 
conjunction with Crawford County officials 
will determine the best course of action involving those 
products, which
 may be affected.
  The TOCD will formulate appropriate PAA(s) for concurrence from the Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture, 
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and others. Once finalized, 
these will be issued as Protective Action 
Directives (PADs) through official notification channels and the news media.
  The full range of options for protecting public health and safety is delineated in Annex V, Chapter 12. A 
summary of those potential act
ions for Crawford County will be provided to key county officials.
  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
:  Additional, specific information will be provided to Crawford County on a continuing basis. This information 
may include information protected by privacy laws, t
herefore, it will be limited to ﬁneed to knowﬂ access. The 
material may include, but not be limited to:
   Location of dairy farms producing milk for human
 consumption.
   Location of beehives for honey
 production.
   Location of other producers as
 appropriate.
 A guide for farmers and gardeners will be made available for distribution to home gardeners, farmers, and 
farmers 
markets, which
 discusses various ways to mitigate the effect
s of radioactive contamination.
  RECOVERY
:  After radioactive contamination has dr
opped to levels where it is appropriate to relax protective actions, 
including embargos, the TOCD will issue a recommendation to the Crawford County Judge. Once the Judge has 
concurred in those actions, the TOCD will issue a PAD. That information will be d
isseminated through official 
channels and the news media.
  Reimbursement for financial loss due to a radioactive release from ANO falls initially to the American Nuclear 
Insurers (ANI). Additional funding would be addressed should a disaster declaration be
 in effect.
  2021 Annex V ANO Radiological 
Emergency Response, Pg. 
359
     RELOCATION
:  There is a slight chance that counties outside a 10
-mile radius of ANO could have human populations which 
could be adversely impacted by radioactive deposition. The most common cause of this would be due to 
micro
-meteorological 
events, such as heavy rain which could ﬁwashoutﬂ higher concentrations of radiation 
over a confined area. These areas would be identified during the sampling phase of an event, most likely after 
the emergency phase has ended.  If such concentrations exceed
 EPA Protective Action Guides (PAGs), the 
TOCD would issue a PAA for the area, which would need the County Judge to concur. The most likely action 
would be relocation, or evacuation of the population until PAGS were no longer exceeded.
 NOTIFICATION OF THE 
PUBLIC:
  The public will be notified of any PAA, including relocation, by use of news media outlets, and the use of 
electronic messaging using ﬁpushﬂ technology where available. ADH will also make this information available 
through the agency™s online port

Appendix 12
-4 Garland 
County
  SITUATION:
  Persons in areas outside of abo
ut a ten
-mile radius of a commercial nuclear power station are not expected to 
receive direct exposure to ionizing radiation. However, there could be adverse consequences from deposition 
from an airborne plume containing radioactive material onto ground su
rfaces in an area out to about 50 miles, 
referred to as the Ingestion Pathway Zone (IPZ).
  Garland County is located in a generally southerly direction from ANO, starting at approximately 37 miles 
(Attachment Garland A). While the entire county is not in t
he IPZ, approximately 303 Square miles or 194,062 
acres of the county are included in the ANO IPZ (Attachment Garland B).
  A summary of potential agricultural products and activities, as well as other products and activities which 
could be affected by radi
oactive ground deposition is shown in Attachment Garland C to this appendix, 
List of 
Agricultural and Other Products Pote
ntially Affected by Deposition.
 PURPOSE:
  The purpose of this Appendix is to delineate the procedures which Garland County officials wi
ll follow 
in responding to a deposition of radioactive material from ANO in the county.
  NOTIFICATION AND ACTIVATION:
  The Garland County Warning Point (WP), located at the County 911 center will receive notification of a 
radioactive release with a potenti
al impact on Garland County from the State as outlined in Attachment A 
of Annex V, Chapter 12.
  If received via an unsecured system, such as commercial telephone, the WP will authenticate the notification 
message by an approved method and will then alert k
ey county officials as deta
iled in Attachment Garland D 
to 
this appendix.
     2021 Annex V ANO 
Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
387
    Upon notification, Key Officials (see Attachment Garland E), at a minimum, the County Judge, County 
Emergency Management Director, and the County Agriculture Agent, or their desig
nee, will report to the 
Garland County EOC, located at 401 Mid
-America Road, Hot Springs, Arkansas.
  Key County Officials will initially follow the steps described in the IPZ EOC 
Activation Checklist 
(Attachment 
Garland F).
  The State will establish contac
t with the Garland County EOC via commercial telephone, or an alternate means 
such as AWIN radio. This initial contact will layout procedures for; establishing a conference call between the 
State and affected county(ies); method for receiving plume plot an
d projected deposition maps; and for 
coordinating information for official news releases.
  Key County Officials will review the list of potential exposure to radioactive ground deposition as contained in 
Attachment Garland C.
  PRE
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  The 
ADH Technical Operations Control Director (TOCD) may elect to issue pre
-deposition Protective Action 
Advisories (PAAs) to minimize the potential effects of radioactive material on some products.
 These include:
   Placing livestock and/or poultry on stored fe
ed and
 water.
   Covering outdoor sources of animal feed, such as, covering hay
 bales.
   Covering outdoor sources of water for animals, such as, troughs and
 tanks.
   Other preventative measures, as
 appropriate.
   The temporary embargo of foodstuffs, including l
ivestock, poultry, and crops for 
human or animal
 consumption.
  In the event a PAA is issued for areas including Garland County, the County Judge will review the PAA and 
concur in its implementation as appropriate.
  Determining areas of actual deposition an
d level of contamination will be the responsibility of the State, with 
assistance of Federal agencies, including the EPA.
  2021 Annex V ANO Radiological 
Emergency Response, Pg. 
388
     POST
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  Once the area of deposition and the level and type of radioisotopes have been determined, the State, in 
conjunction with Garland County officials will determine the best course of action involving those 
products, which
 may be affected.
  The TOCD will formulate appropriate PAA(s) for concurrence from the Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture, 
Arkansas Game and Fish
 Commission and others. Once finalized, these will be issued as Protective Action 
Directives (PADs) through official notification channels and the news media.
  The full range of options for protecting public health and safety is delineated in Annex V, Chap
ter 12. A 
summary of those potential actions for Garland County will be pr
ovided to key county officials.
  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
  Additional, specific information will be provided to Garland County on a continuing basis.  This information 
may include i
nformation protected by privacy laws, therefore, it will be limited to ﬁneed to knowﬂ access. The 
material may include, but not be limited to:
   Location of dairy farms producing milk for human
 consumption.
   Location of beehives for honey
 production.
   Locat
ion of other producers as
 appropriate.
  A guide for farmers and gardeners will be made available for distribution to home gardeners, farmers, and 
farmers markets which discusses various ways to mitigate the effects of radioactive contamination.
  RECOVERY:
  After radioactive contamination has dropped to levels where it is appropriate to relax protective actions, 
including embargos, the TOCD will issue a recommendation to the Garland County Judge. Once the Judge has 
concurred in those actions, the TOCD will i
ssue a PAD. That information will be disseminated through offici
al channels and the news media.
  Reimbursement for financial loss due to a radioactive release from ANO falls initially to the American Nuclear 
Insurers (ANI). Additional funding would be addr
essed should a disaster declaration be in effect.
      2021 Annex V ANO Radiological 
Emergency Response, Pg. 
389
    RELOCATION:
  There is a slight chance that counties outside a 10
-mile radius of ANO could have human 
populations, which
 could be adversely impacted by radioactive deposition. The most common cause of th
is would be due to 
micro
-meteorological events, such as heavy rain which could ﬁwashoutﬂ higher concentrations of radiation 
over a confined area. These areas would be identified during the sampling phase of an event, most likely after 
the emergency phase h
as ended.  If such concentrations exceed EPA Protective Action Guides (PAGs), the 
TOCD would issue a PAA for the area, which would need the County Judge to concur. The most likely action 
would be 
relocation
 or evacuation of the population until PAGS were n
o longer exceeded.
  NOTIFICATION OF PUBLIC:
  The public will be notified of any PAA, including relocation, by use of news media outlets, and the use of 
electronic messaging using ﬁpushﬂ technology where available. ADH will also make this information availa
ble 
through the agency™s online portal.

Appendix 12
-7 Newton County
  SITUATION:
  Persons in areas outside of about a ten
-mile radius of a commercial nuclear power station are not expected to 
receive direct exposure to ionizing 
radiation. However, there could be adverse consequences from deposition 
from an airborne plume containing radioactive material onto ground surfaces in an area out to about 50 miles, 
referred to as the Ingestion Pathway Zone (IPZ).
  Newton County is located
 in a generally northerly direction from Arkansas Nuclear One (ANO), starting at 
approximately 28.9 miles (Attachment Newton A). While the entire county is not in the IPZ, approximately 265 
Square miles or 404,944 acres of the county are included in the AN
O IPZ (Attachment Newton B).
  A summary of potential agricultural products and activities, as well as other products and activities which could 
be affected by radioactive ground deposition is shown in Attachment Newton C to this appendix, 
List of 
Agricultu
ral and Other Products Pote
ntially Affected by Deposition.
 PURPOSE:
  The purpose of this Appendix is to delineate the 
procedures, which
 Newton County officials will follow 
in responding to a deposition of radioactive material from ANO in the county.
  NOTIF
ICATION AND ACTIVATION:
  The Newton County Warning Point (WP), located at the County 911 center will receive notification of a 
radioactive release with a potential impact on Newton County from the State as outlined in Attachment A of 
Annex V, Chapter 12.
  If received via an unsecured system, such as commercial telephone, the WP will authenticate the notification 
message by an approved method and will then alert key county officials as detailed in Attachment Newton D 
to this appendix.
  2021 Annex V ANO Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
417
     Upon notification, Ke
y Officials (see Attachment Newton E), at a minimum, the County Judge, County 
Emergency Management Director, and the County Agriculture Agent, or their designee, will report to the 
Newton County IPZ CP; located at 435 Court Street, Jasper, Arkansas. Key Co
unty Officials will initially follow 
the steps described in the IPZ CP 
Activation Checklist 
(Attachment Newton F).
  The State will establish contact with the Newton County IPZ CP via commercial telephone, or an alternate 
means such as AWIN radio. This init
ial contact will layout procedures for; establishing a conference call 
between the State and affected county(ies); method for receiving plume plot and projected deposition maps; 
and for coordinating information for official news releases.
  Key County Offic
ials will review the list of potential exposure to radioactive ground deposition as co
ntained in 
Attachment Newton C.
  PRE
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) Technical Operations Control Director (TOCD) may elect to issue 
pre
-depo
sition Protective Action Advisories (PAAs) to minimize the potential effects of radioactive material on 
some products.  These include:
   Placing livestock and/or poultry on stored feed and
 water.
   Covering outdoor sources of animal feed, such as, covering h
ay bales.
   Covering outdoor sources of water for animals, such as, troughs and
 tanks.
   Other preventative measures, as
 appropriate.
   The temporary embargo of foodstuffs, including livestock, poultry, and crops for 
human or animal
 consumption.
  In the event
 a PAA is issued for areas including Newton County, the County Judge will review the PAA and 
concur in its implementation as appropriate.
  Determining areas of actual deposition and level of contamination will be the responsibility of the State, with 
assis
tance of Federal agencies, including the EPA.
  2021 Annex V ANO 
Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
418
    POST
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  Once the area of deposition and the level and type of radioisotopes have been determined, the State, in 
conjunction with Newton County officials will determine the best course of acti
on involving those products 
which may be affected.
  The TOCD will formulate appropriate PAA(s) for concurrence from the Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture, 
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and others. Once finalized, these will be issued as Protective Acti
on 
Directives (PADs) through official notification channels and the news media.
  The full range of options for protecting public health and safety is delineated in Annex V, Chapter 12. A 
summary of those potential actions for Newton County will be provided
 to key county officials.
  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
  Additional, specific information will be provided to Newton County on a continuing basis.  This information 
may include information protected by privacy laws, therefore, it will be limited to ﬁneed to k
nowﬂ access. The 
material may include, but not be limited to:
   Location of dairy farms producing milk for human
 consumption.
   Location of beehives for honey
 production.
   Location of other producers as
 appropriate.
  A guide for farmers and gardeners will be
 made available for distribution to home gardeners, farmers, and 
farmers 
markets, which
 discusses various ways to mitigate the effects of radioactive contamination.
  RECOVERY:
  After radioactive contamination has dropped to levels where it is appropriate t
o relax protective actions, 
including embargos, the TOCD will issue a recommendation to the Newton County Judge. Once the Judge has 
concurred in those actions, the TOCD will issue a PAD. That information will be disseminated through official 
channels and t
he news media.
  Reimbursement for financial loss due to a radioactive release from ANO falls initially to the American Nuclear
 Insurers (ANI). Additional funding would be addressed should a disaster declaration be in effect. 
RELOCATION:
     2021 Annex V ANO 
Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
419
    There is a sligh
t chance that counties outside a 10
-mile radius of ANO could have human 
populations, which
 could be adversely impacted by radioactive deposition. The most common cause of this would be due to 
micro
-meteorological events, such as heavy rain which could ﬁwas
houtﬂ higher concentrations of radiation 
over a confined area. These areas would be identified during the sampling phase of an event, most likely after 
the emergency phase has ended.  If such concentrations exceed EPA Protective Action Guides (PAGs), the 
TOCD would issue a PAA for the area, which would need the County Judge to concur. The most 
likely
 action 
would be 
relocation
 or evacuation of the population until PAGS were no longer exceeded.
  NOTIFICATION OF THE PUBLIC:
  The public will be notified of any
 PAA, including relocation, by use of news media outlets, and the use of 
electronic messaging using ﬁpushﬂ technology where available. ADH will also make this information available 
through the agency™s online portal.

Appendix 12
-10 Saline 
County
  SITUATION:
  Persons in areas outside of about a ten
-mile radius of a commercial nuclear power sta
tion are not expected to 
receive direct exposure to ionizing radiation. However, there could be adverse consequences from deposition 
from an airborne plume containing radioactive material onto ground surfaces in an area out to about 50 miles, 
referred to a
s the Ingestion Pathway Zone (IPZ).
  Saline County is located in a generally southeasterly direction from ANO, starting at approximately 32.4 miles 
(Attachment Saline A). While the entire county is not in the IPZ, approximately 251 Square miles or 161,209 
acres of the county are included in the ANO IPZ (Attachment Saline B).
  A summary of potential agricultural products and activities, as well as other products and activities which could 
be affected by radioactive ground deposition is shown in Attachment Sa
line C to this appendix, 
List of 
Agricultural and Other Products Pote
ntially Affected by Deposition.
 PURPOSE:
  The purpose of this Appendix is to delineate the procedures which Saline County officials will follow in 
responding to a deposition of radioactiv
e material from ANO in the county.
  NOTIFICATION AND ACTIVATION:
  The Saline County Warning Point (WP), located at the County 911 center will receive notification of a 
radioactive release with a potential impact on Saline County from the State as outlined 
in Attachment A of 
Annex V, Chapter 12.
  If received via an unsecured system, such as commercial telephone, the WP will authenticate the notification 
message by an approved method and will then alert key county officials as detailed in Attachment Saline D 
to 
this appendix.
  Upon notification, Key Officials (see Attachment Saline E), at a minimum, the County Judge, County Emergency 
Management Director, and the County Agriculture Agent, or their designee, will report to the Saline County 
EOC; located at 102 S
outh Main Str
eet, Level B, Benton, Arkansas.
  Key County Officials will initially follow the steps described in the IPZ EOC 
Activation Checklist 
(Attachment 
Saline F).
     2021 Annex V ANO Radiologic
al Emergency Response, Pg. 
447
    The State will establish contact with the Saline County EOC via commercial telephone,
 or an alternate means 
such as AWIN radio. This initial contact will layout procedures for; establishing a conference call between the 
State and affected county(ies); method for receiving plume plot and projected deposition maps; and for 
coordinating infor
mation for official news releases.
  Key County Officials will review the list of potential exposure to radioactive ground deposition as contained in 
Attachment Saline C.
  PRE
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  The ADH Technical Operations Control Director (TOCD) may ele
ct to issue pre
-deposition Protective Action 
Advisories (PAAs) to minimize the potential effects of radioactive material on some products.
 These include:
   Placing livestock and/or poultry on stored feed and
 water.
   Covering outdoor sources of animal feed, 
such as, covering hay
 bales.
   Covering outdoor sources of water for animals, such as, troughs and
 tanks.
   Other preventative measures, as
 appropriate.
   The temporary embargo of foodstuffs, including livestock, poultry, and crops for 
human or animal
 consump
tion.
  In the event a PAA is issued for areas including Saline County, the County Judge will review the PAA and concur 
in its implementation as appropriate.
  Determining areas of actual deposition and level of contamination will be the responsibility of th
e State, with 
assistance of Federal agencies, including the EPA.
   POST
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  Once the area of deposition and the level and type of radioisotopes have been determined, the State, in 
conjunction with Saline County officials will determine the
 best course of action involving those 
products, 
which
 may be affected.
  2021 Annex V 
ANO Radiological Emergency Response, Pg. 
448
      The TOCD will formulate appropriate PAA(s) for concurrence from the Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture, 
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and others. Once finalized, these will be is
sued as Protective Action 
Directives (PADs) through official notification channels and the news media.
  The full range of options for protecting public health and safety is delineated in Annex V, Chapter 12. A 
summary of 
those potential actions
 for Saline 
County will be pr
ovided to key county officials.
  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
  Additional, specific information will be provided to Saline County on a continuing basis. This information may 
include information protected by privacy laws, therefore, it will be
 limited to ﬁneed to knowﬂ access. The 
material may include, but not be limited to:
   Location of dairy farms producing milk for human
 consumption.
   Location of beehives for honey
 production.
   Location of other producers as
 appropriate
  A guide for farmers 
and gardeners will be made available for distribution to home gardeners, farmers, and 
farmers 
markets, which
 discusses various ways to mitigate the effects of radioactive contamination.
  RECOVERY:
   After radioactive contamination has dropped to levels whe
re it is appropriate to relax protective actions, 
including embargos, the TOCD will issue a recommendation to the Saline County Judge. Once the Judge has 
concurred in those actions, the TOCD will issue a PAD. That information will be disseminated through o
fficial 
channels and the news media.
  Reimbursement for financial loss due to a radioactive release from ANO falls initially to the American Nuclear 
Insurers (ANI).  Additional funding would be addressed should a dis
aster declaration be in effect.
  RELOCAT
ION:
  There is a slight chance that counties outside a 10
-mile radius of ANO could have human populations which 
could be adversely impacted by radioactive deposition. The most commo
n cause of this would be due to 
micro
-meteorological events, such as heavy 
rain, which
 could ﬁwashoutﬂ higher concentrations of radiation 
over a confined area. These areas would be identified during the sampling phase of an event, most likely 
after the emergency phase has ended.  If such concentrations exceed EPA Protective Actio
n Guides (PAGs), 
the TOCD would issue a PAA for the area, which would need the County Judge to concur. The most likely 
action would be relocation, or evacuation of the population until PAGS were no longer exceeded.

Sebastian 
County
  SITUATION:
  Persons in areas outside of about a ten
-mile radius of a commercial nuclear power station are not expected to 
receive direct expo
sure to ionizing radiation. However, there could be adverse consequences from deposition 
from an airborne plume containing radioactive material onto ground surfaces in an area out to about 50 miles, 
referred to as the Ingestion Pathway Zone (IPZ).
  Sebasti
an County is located in a generally westerly direction from ANO, starting at approximately 45.5 miles 
(Attachment Sebastian A). While the entire county is not in the IPZ, approximately 47 Square miles or 30,393 
acres of the county are included in the ANO I
PZ (Attachment Sebastian B).
  A summary of potential agricultural products and activities, as well as other products and 
activities, which 
could be affected by radioactive ground deposition,
 is shown in Attachment Sebastian C to this appendix, 
List 
of Agri
cultural and Other Products Pote
ntially Affected by Deposition.
 PURPOSE:
  The purpose of this Appendix is to delineate the 
procedures, which
 Sebastian County officials will follow 
in responding to a deposition of radioactive material from ANO in the county
.  NOTIFICATION AND ACTIVATION:
  The Sebastian County Warning Point (WP), located at the County 911 center will receive notification of a 
radioactive release with a potential impact on Sebastian County from the State as outlined in Attac
hment A 
of Annex V,
 Chapter 12.
  If received via an unsecured system, such as commercial telephone, the WP will authenticate the notification 
message by an approved method and will then alert key county officials as detailed in Attachment Sebastian D 
to this appendix.
  2021 Annex V 
ANO Radiological Emergency 
Response, Pg. 
477
     Upon 
notification, Key Officials (see Attachment Sebastian E), at a minimum, the County Judge, County 
Emergency Management Director, and the County Agriculture Agent, or their designee, will report to the 
Sebastian County EOC located at 8400 South Zero, Ft. Smi
th, Arkansas. Key County Officials will initially follow 
the steps described in the IPZ EOC 
Activation Checklist 
(Attachment Sebastian F).
  The State will establish contact with the Sebastian County EOC via commercial telephone, or an alternate 
means such 
as AWIN radio. This initial contact will layout procedures for; establishing a conference call 
between the State and affected county(ies); method for receiving plume plot and projected deposition maps; 
and for coordinating information for official news rel
eases.
  Key County Officials will review the list of potential exposure to radioactive ground deposition as contained in 
Attachment Sebastian C.
  PRE
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) Technical Operations Control Director (TOCD) 
may elect to issue 
pre
-deposition Protective Action Advisories (PAAs) to minimize the potential effects of radioactive material on 
some products.  These include:
   Placing livestock and/or poultry on stored feed and
 water
  Covering outdoor sources of animal 
feed, such as, covering hay
 bales
  Covering outdoor sources of water for animals, such as, troughs and
 tanks
  Other preventative measures, as
 appropriate
  The temporary embargo of foodstuffs, including livestock, poultry, and crops for 
human or animal
 consump
tion.
  In the event a PAA is issued for areas including Sebastian County, the County Judge will review the PAA and 
concur in its implementation as appropriate.
  Determining areas of actual deposition and level of contamination will be the responsibility of
 the State, with 
assistance of Federal agencies, including the EPA.
  2021 
An

      POST
-DEPOSITION ACTIONS:
  Once the area of deposition and the level and type of radioisotopes have been determined, the State, in 
conjunction with Sebastian County officials will determ
ine the best course of action involving those 
products, which
 may be affected.
  The TOCD will formulate appropriate PAA(s) for concurrence from the Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture, 
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and others. Once finalized, these will 
be issued as Protective Action 
Directives (PADs) through official notification channels and the news media.
  The full range of options for protecting public health and safety is delineated in Annex V, Chapter 12. A 
summary of those potential actions for Se
bastian County will be provided to key county officials.
  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
  Additional, specific information will be provided to Sebastian County on a continuing basis. This information 
may include information protected by privacy laws, therefore,
 it will be limited to ﬁneed to knowﬂ access. The 
material may include, but not be limited to:
   Location of dairy farms producing milk for human
 consumption.
   Location of beehives for honey
 production.
   Location of other producers as
 appropriate.
  A guide 
for farmers and gardeners will be made available for distribution to home gardeners, farmers, and 
farmers 
markets, which
 discusses various ways to mitigate the effects of radioactive contamination.
  RECOVERY:
  After radioactive contamination has dropped to
 levels where it is appropriate to relax protective actions, 
including embargos, the TOCD will issue a recommendation to the Sebastian County Judge. Once the Judge 
has concurred in those actions, the TOCD will issue a PAD. That information will be dissemin
ated through 
offici
al channels and the news media. 
Reimbursement for financial loss due to a radioactive release from 
ANO falls initially to the American Nuclear Insurers (ANI). Additional funding would be addressed should a 
disaster declaration be in effe
ct.

 479
    RELOCATION:
  There is a slight chance that counties outside a 10
-mile radius of ANO could have human 
populations, which
 could be adversely impacted by radioactive deposition. The most common cause of this would be due to 
micro
-meteorological events,
 such as heavy rain which could ﬁwashoutﬂ higher concentrations of radiation 
over a confined area. These areas would be identified during the sampling phase of an event, most likely after 
the emergency phase has ended.  If such concentrations exceed EPA Pr
otective Action Guides (PAGs), the 
TOCD would issue a PAA for the area, which would need the County Judge to concur. The most likely action 
would be 
relocation
 or evacuation of the population until PAGS were no longer exceeded.
  NOTIFICATION OF THE PUBLIC:
  The public will be notified of any PAA, including relocation, by use of news media outlets, and the use of 
electronic messaging using ﬁpushﬂ technology where available. ADH will also make this information available 
through the agency™s online portal.

  Introduction
 Purpose
 The purpose of the Biological Incident Support Annex to the Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency 
Management Plan (ARCEMP) is to provide a
 framework for implementing the ARCEMP for those 
emergencies within the State which require the following:
  Coordination of statewide health and medical services to augment or replace local 
capabilities which have been disrupted or destroyed.
  Augmentation o
f normal health protection and surveillance activities
  Assistance in damage assessment and restoration of essential health and medical services.
 The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) is the agency of state government which has been 
entrusted with coordin
ation of health and medical response activities in the event of a major emergency 
or disaster situation. The processes and procedures described in this annex ensure that assistance is 
provided expeditiously. They also ensure that health and medical operati
ons are conducted in 
accordance with established law, policies, regulations, and standards in the event of a biological incident 
of catastrophic magnitude.  The provisions of this Annex also provide general guidance to mitigate the 
effects of a biological 
incident and are intended to compliment the Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency 
Management Plan (ARCEMP) and its annexes.  The biological incident function is a component of 
Emergency Support Function (ESF) #8 
Œ Public Health and Medical Services.
  Scope
  The
 provisions of this Annex constitute general guidance for activities intended to mitigate the 
harmful effects of accidents, or natural and/or man
-caused disasters, which result in a threat to public 
or individual health.
  A pandemic is considered a high
-pr
obability event.  Pandemics struck four times in the 20
th and 
21st centuries, causing varying degrees of illness and death. 
     2021 Biological Incident Support Annex, Pg. 
498
  Authorities
  To acquire a more comprehensive understanding of the Arkansas Department of Health™s 
response to a biological incide
nt, several documents should be referenced.  These include the ESF #8 
Annex of the ARCEMP, the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), the 
Arkansas Influenza Pandemic Response Plan, and the Arkansas Strategic National Stockpile
 Plan.  These 
plans are on file at the ADH.
  Policies
  All deploying State resources remain under the control of their respective State department 
or agency during mobilization and deployment.
  State resources arriving at a State mobilization center or stagi
ng area should remain there 
until requested by local incident command authorities, when they are integrated into the 
incident response effort.
  Local entities are encouraged to conduct planning in collaboration with the State for 
catastrophic incidents as p
art of their normal preparedness activities.
  The State, in collaboration with local entities, develops proactive plans for activation and 
implementation of the Biological Incident Support Annex, to include situations where local 
governments are incapable o
f responding and where the State may temporarily assume 
roles typically performed by local governments.
  Situation
  Residents of Arkansas are vulnerable to disasters or major emergencies, which could result 
in a need for augmentation of health protection an
d surveillance activities, as well as 
medical services support. 
  The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) is the state agency with regulatory authority over 
health and medical services provided by individuals, local organizations, governments, and 
quasi
-gov
ernmental organizations.
  Communicable disease control and epidemiological surveillance, food and drug inspection, 
analysis and evaluation of public water and wastewater, radiation protection, as well as 
other functions are performed directly by ADH on a st
atewide basis.
   2021 Biological Incident Support Annex, Pg. 
499
   Biological incidents are expected, but unpredictable.  Disease outbreaks can be expected to 
occur simultaneously throughout much of the U.S., preventing shifts in human and material 
resources that usually occur in the response to other disas
ters.  Many geographic areas 
within the state, or the entire state, may be affected simultaneously. 
  Planning Assumptions
  Disasters or major emergencies could overload or destroy the capability of local emergency 
service organizations and medical care pro
viders.
  The Central Office of the ADH may be required to augment the capabilities of the Regional 
and Local Health Units.
  The ADH may be required to provide coordination of medical and/or mortuary services.  The 
ADH will work closely with the Arkansas Medi
cal Society, the Arkansas Hospital Association, 
the Arkansas Ambulance Owners & Operators Association, Arkansas Board of Funeral 
Directors and Embalmers, and other provider organizations as necessary.
  Local emergency service organizations and medical care 
providers that are still functional 
after a disaster or major emergency may need assistance and/or guidance from the ADH 
concerning how best to provide services on a temporarily accelerated basis.
  Impairment of local services may require ADH technical assi
stance and/or guidance in 
restoration or replacement of facilities and equipment.
  The public will require guidance concerning how to avoid health hazards associated with 
conditions existing during the response and recovery phase.
  The ADH will provide the n
ecessary support as available and appropriate.  When additional 
resources are required, the ADH will coordinate the solicitation and provision of federal 
and/or private provider support.
  A biological incident in Arkansas will present a massive test of any 
emergency preparedness 
system.  It is likely to cause substantial illness, death, social disruption, and widespread 
panic.
  Widespread illness in the community will increase the likelihood of sudden and potentially 
significant shortages of personnel in othe
r sectors who provide critical community services.
  There may be critical shortages of health care resources such as staffed hospital beds, 
mechanical ventilators, morgue capacity, temporary holding sites with refrigeration for 
  2021 Biological Incident Support Annex, Pg. 
500
  storage of bodies, drugs, and
 other resources.  CDC models estimate increases in 
hospitalization and intensive care unit demand of more than 25% even in a moderate 
pandemic.
  Businesses should be prepared to operate with 50% of their personnel.
  The effect of a pandemic will be relative
ly long lived (months) in comparison with other 
types of disasters.
  Assuming that prior vaccination(s) may offer some protection, existing vaccination 
programs, supplemented when indicated, will remain a cornerstone of disease outbreak 
prevention.
  Effectiv
e preventative and therapeutic measures (vaccines and antiviral medications) may 
not exist or may be in short supply if they are available.
  The Federal government may assume the cost for purchase of vaccines, antiviral 
medications and related supplies.
  The
 state may request the Strategic National Stockpile (pharmaceuticals, vaccines, medical 
supplies, equipment and other items to augment local supplies of critical medical items) 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
  Concept of Operations
 Coo
rdinating Agency
 Under ESF #8, the Arkansas Department Health (ADH) will be the Coordinating Agency
 and has 
been entrusted with coordination of health and medical response activities in the event of a major 
emergency or disaster situation. 
  The ADH Emergen
cy Communications Center (ECC) serves as the official point of contact for 
notification by the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) of incidents 
requiring response from the ADH.  Notification will normally be made by ADEM to the ECC.
  In the eve
nt of any situation within the state requiring an emergency response by the ADH, 
the ADH EOP will be activated, either fully or partially, depending on the nature of the 
incident.
  The ADH™s responsibilities are outlined in the ADH EOP and are, therefore, n
ot repeated in 
this Annex.
   2021 Biological Incident Support Annex, Pg. 
501
   The ADH is the lead agency in the event of a biological incident to include a pandemic and 
has the authority to contain and control disease outbreaks (Arkansas Code 20
-7-109, 2000).  
The State Health Officer may choose to initiat
e the Arkansas Influenza Pandemic Response 
Plan and the ADH EOC and/or to request the Strategic National Stockpile.
  The ADH will receive support in performing functions related to the biological incident from 
other state agencies and organizations.  The AD
H will access the resources of these other 
agencies and organizations through coordination with the State EOC.
  The ADH coordinates Bioterrorism Preparedness efforts to enable the public health system 
to prepare for and respond to bioterrorism, communicable
 disease outbreaks, and other 
public health emergencies.
  The ADH will notify the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) in the event 
of an actual or suspected bioterrorism related event.  ADEM will notify all relevant support 
agencies.
  The ADH co
ordinates the activation and implementation of the Strategic National Stockpile 
in response to bioterrorism, communicable disease outbreaks, and other public health 
emergencies.  (See ADH, Plan for Acquisition and Distribution of the Strategic National 
Sto
ckpile under separate cover).  This document is available at the ADH, Emergency 
Operations Center 24/7.
  The Public Health Preparedness and Emergency Response Branch is responsible for the Bio
-Terrorism Program including the Strategic National Stockpile and
 the oversight of the 
Emergency Communication Center.
   The Infectious Disease Branch (IDB) and the Preparedness Syndromic Surveillance Program 
of the Arkansas Department of Health maintains situational awareness of reports of disease 
outbreaks internationa
lly and nationally as well as conducts surveillance within Arkansas.  
IDB provides guidance and direction in the management of communicable disease 
outbreaks.  At the outset of a pandemic, the information and guidance provided by IDB will 
enable the State 
Health Officer to decide on activation of the ADH Emergency Operations 
Center (EOC) for enhancing a coordinated response to the pandemic (protocols for the EOC 
are found in the ADH EOP).  Information and guidance from IDB will also serve to advise the 
Stat
e Health Officer, Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) and the 
Governor.

  Introduction
 The National Response Framework defines a catastrophic incident as ﬁAny natural or manmade 
incident, including terrorism that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or 
disruption severely affecting the population, in
frastructure, environment, economy, national morale, or 
government functions.ﬂ The nature of a catastrophe is that the disaster is of such magnitude that full 
recovery will take years and possibly decades. The affected area is likely never to be the same a
s before 
the catastrophe. ‚Normal™ will be a new normal.
 Policies
 In a catastrophic earthquake event, the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) 
directs implementation of the Joint Arkansas 
- FEMA Region 6 New Madrid Seismic Zone Earthquake 
Plan 
Œ 2018. 
 The occurrence or threat of multiple, successive catastrophic incidents may significantly reduce 
the size, speed, and depth of the state response. 
 The state may hold certain resources in reserve in case of additional incidents. 
 The state will al
locate finite resources in such a way that they make the greatest possible 
positive impact.
 All ESFs will maximize utilization of scarce resources.
 Situation
 Following a catastrophic incident, segments of local governments, nongovernmental 
organizations (N
GOs) and the private sector will be severely compromised. The State will assist these 
entities toward continuity of government and operations (COG and COOP). 
 Normal procedures for certain Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) may be expedited or 
streamlined 
to address the magnitude of urgent requirements of the incident. 
 Assumptions
  Cascading/Secondary effects will occur and cause additional damage. Some types of 
succeeding events will require that the damage assessment process start over.
  Individuals will f
ocus on family support and care first. Specific disaster conditions will affect 
  2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
509
  each individual™s ability to perform in their typical response capacity.
  Weather conditions will affect every aspect of response, particularly in an earthquake event. 
  Communit
ies and individuals in earthquake peril have been encouraged to prepare to be 
self
-sufficient for 7
-10 days. 
  Affected counties will be attempting to meet their own emergency needs and will be unable 
to provide assistance to adjacent counties. Response cap
ability will also be limited by any 
damage to or restricted use of emergency facilities and equipment.
  If conventional communications systems are compromised, alternate means of 
communication such as satellite phones and ham radios can be used.
  Residents a
ffected by catastrophic earthquake will try to shelter in place as long as possible, 
but will eventually evacuate due to failure of critical infrastructure that typically supports 
communities.
  There will be service animals and/or pets that require shelter.
  Initially air traffic control may be limited or unavailable.
  Crime will increase.
  Critical infrastructure will be compromised, depending on the nature of the catastrophe.
  The amount of debris resulting from a catastrophic earthquake will exceed the state 
and 
local governments™ ability to dispose of it.  The presence of or search for human remains will 
negatively impact the debris mission.  
  Post
-catastrophic earthquake, banking and financial institutions will not be fully operational. 
The affected areas wi
ll become cash and barter societies until the financial infrastructure is 
restored.
  Catastrophic contagion will increase use of electronic financial transaction capability as the 
population uses social distancing as a way to avoid contracting the illness.
  The President will declare a federal disaster.  
  Fuel will become scarce in the affected areas. 
  Initial reports of damage will provide an incomplete or distorted picture of the extent of the 
damage.
  Working relationships already exist between municipal of
ficials (including those at the state 
level), emergency managers, school superintendents, Public Health, medical/hospital 
administration, utilities and others with roles in disaster response. 
     2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
510
   Infrastructure recovery will begin after the initial response
 phase and there will be resources 
available to support the repair personnel and equipment.
  Each county has identified at least one staging area inside its borders where resources can 
be received, stockpiled, and allocated, before being dispatched. Some of
 the identified areas 
will also be used at collection points and emergency treatment facilities for casualties and 
evacuees.
  Concept of Operations
 Watch Phase
 During the watch phase, conditions are such that a catastrophic incident could develop. 
Activiti
es triggered by a watch phase are primarily informational. Potential responders maintain 
awareness of the threat, the likelihood that it will manifest itself into an event, and its potential to 
become a disaster or for the situation to deteriorate further 
into a catastrophic incident.
 Watch phases for some catastrophes, such as earthquakes, are perpetual because there is no 
warning. Watch phases for others, such as hurricanes, are for well
-defined time periods 
Œ June through 
October. In some cases steps can
 be taken to eliminate the threat. An example would be a widespread 
and long term power failure. A work
-around or temporary repair might prevent the incident altogether. 
 Preparedness Phase
 The actions during this phase are those that require time to compl
ete.  They include mitigation, 
training, planning, public awareness and any activities that require long
-term programs to accomplish 
their objectives.
 These preparedness activities take place in the normal living and working environments of the 
participant
s. Warning Phase
 During the warning phase, an incident is imminent. Activities triggered by a warning phase are 
aimed at evacuating the area at risk and/or withstanding the effects of the hazard. Information is also 
very important during this phase. The at
-risk population needs to know where to go, how much time is 
left, what to expect upon impact, etc. These activities must generally be completed in a very short time. 
  2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
511
  Tasks can be most effectively performed during the warning phase if due diligence was exe
rcised during 
the preparedness phase.
 Response Phase
 The actions during this phase are emergency response activities undertaken during the first few 
days, or few weeks, after the incident.
 These actions are taken immediately after an incident with the goal
 of saving lives, alleviating 
suffering, preventing further damage, injury, or loss of life after the disaster.
 Recovery Phase
 Short
-Term.
  The actions during this phase are the first steps toward restoring the affected area to an 
inhabitable condition. Sho
rt term recovery will likely begin while the response phase is still 
in progress.
  These actions will begin as early as possible with the intent of returning the affected area to 
normal conditions.
  Short term recovery truly begins when life
-saving efforts a
re no longer necessary or 
productive.
 Long
-Term.
  Long term recovery from a catastrophic event will, by definition, take years. It may take 
decades and the area may never again resemble what it was before the incident.
  These actions will continue, as reason
 dictates, for as long as it takes to restore some form 
of normalcy to:
 o State and local governments.
 o School, water and other special districts.
 o Private medical care.
 o Industry and business.
 o Citizens™ health, safety, food acquisition, housing and employment.
  Emphasis will be placed upon restoration and rehabilitation of the damaged areas. A major 
part of long term recovery is to mitigate 
Œ rebuild in such a way that the same scenario 
doesn™t unfold again.
   2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
512
  Organization
 Catastrophic incident response will be th
e same as any other response, but on a larger scale. 
Arkansas follows NIMS guidelines and the principals in the Incident Command System.
  Responsibilities
 The Basic Plan section and the sixteen emergency support function annexes to the ARCEMP 
offer details
 about how the roles are filled and responsibilities are met in Arkansas emergency 
operations. 
 Preparedness. 
The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) is the lead agency in 
proposing legislation and developing programs for catastrophic incident
 preparedness. While 
earthquake is by no means Arkansas™ only potential catastrophe, Arkansas recognizes that earthquake is 
the most likely cause of such a disaster in the state. For those reasons, Arkansas plans response to a 
catastrophic seismic event. T
he knowledge, skills, and abilities developed for earthquake will be 
appropriately used in response to other disasters.
 With support from other state agencies and other organizations, ADEM has accepted the 
following responsibilities.
 State
-wide seismic saf
ety planning
. This policy and program development includes conduct that 
can reduce or prevent the threat to life and property from earthquakes and their secondary effects.  
Examples are:
  Planning for future development and redevelopment, taking into accoun
t the potential 
threat of earthquakes and the secondary effects of landslides, liquefaction, fire, and ground 
rupture.
  Encouraging local governments to enact and enforce zoning ordinances and other 
appropriate land
-use controls.
  Formulating, enacting and p
romoting seismic building codes and performance standards for 
new building construction and reconstruction.
  Formulating a post
-earthquake plan for recovery and redevelopment.
  Updating the State Hazard Mitigation Plan.
  Encouraging communities to participate
 in hazard mitigation planning efforts.
   2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
513
   Encouraging property owners to carry earthquake insurance.
 Development of mutual aid and joint powers agreements. 
These are the actions taken to 
establish agreements with public and private sector entities to provide
 resources and logistical 
support for earthquake response:
  Continued participation in the nationwide Emergency Management Assistance Compact 
(EMAC) and to the FEMA Region 6 Interstate Emergency Response Support Plan (IERSP).
  Formulating and adopting specif
ic mutual aid agreements among local, general, and/or 
special purpose governments (e.g. water districts, school districts, etc.) and with private 
entities.
  Negotiating pre
-arranged purchase agree
ments between emergency service provid
ers and 
vendors or co
ntractors.
  Encouraging local and single
-purpose governments, private utilities and other institutions to 
participate in mutual aid or joint powers agreements.
 Development of disaster assistance programs. 
Disaster assistance actions are designed to lessen 
the financial impact of the event on the public and private sectors. Guidelines have been 
developed for eligibility and procedures have been established for the effective delivery of 
disaster assistance after a catastrophic earthquake. Some examples are:
  Inventorying and analyzing sources of financial or in
-kind grant assistance to earthquake 
victims.
  Proposing or supporting legislation to grant increased financial contributions for disaster 
assistance.
  Support for the development of seismic hazard analysis 
to estimate the potential for lives 
lost, injuries sustained, structural damage, transportation losses, business interruptions, 
income losses, power outages, etc. from the direct and indirect effects of damaging seismic 
events.
  Offering instruction in post
-earthquake building evaluation to personnel who will likely be 
tasked with inspecting structures that have sustained varying levels of damage. 
Arkansas has 
expanded this instruction activity to create INSPARK (INSPect ARKansas) which is a cadre of 
volunte
ers trained specifically to do rapid visual inspections of disaster affected buildings to 
determine if they are safe to enter. Further, INSPARK and similar programs in Missouri, 
Tennessee, Illinois, and Indiana, have trained and exercised together to creat
e a robust 
  2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
514
  capability.
 Engineering preparedness
. This task includes:
  Coordinating with the American Society of Civil Engineers Arkansas Section for organization 
and preparation of their voluntary support of structural surveys.
  Encouraging structural hazard
 mitigation in the area of the state subject to earthquake 
damage. 
 Encourage nonstructural hazard mitigation.
 This task includes:
  Identifying nonstructural items such as fixtures and components in homes, workplaces and 
elsewhere which can fall during eart
hquakes and cause injury.
  Proposing a range of cost effective strategies for reducing or eliminating these threats.
 Determine the shortfalls of existing resources
. This task includes:
  Working with state agencies and local jurisdictions to maintain accurate
 information as to 
the resources available inside the state.
  Using an earthquake damage model to estimate the resources required to successfully 
respond and recover from a catastrophic earthquake on the New Madrid Seismic Zone.
  Monitoring medical inventori
es on hand versus the resources needed to respond to a 
pandemic catastrophe.
  Response.
 As in response to any disaster the Governor directs and controls overall emergency 
operations in the state through the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC). 
 When c
atastrophe occurs, the SEOC will increase its activation level and mobilize emergency 
response assets as usual for disaster. Additionally:
  The SEOC will formulate a comprehensive picture of the damage, needs, and state resource 
shortfalls and forward the i
nformation to FEMA. 
  Emergency response personnel will be directed to remove critical equipment and supplies 
from facilities and/or areas threatened by secondary or cascading events. 
  The event will be opened in EMAC and Arkansas will begin to make request
s of less affected 
states to meet response needs.
  Disaster Support Areas (DSAs) will be created to support counties outside the affected areas 
so that they can receive evacuees for registration, feeding, first aid, counseling, guidance, 
  2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
515
  and assignment to s
helters if necessary. 
  Assistance will be requested from FEMA Region 6. Arkansas expects significant regional 
assistance if the catastrophic conditions are due to earthquake.
 The Arkansas Attorney General will handle the following tasks:
  Determining Right
-of
-Entry.
  Hold
-Harmless agreements:
 For individual properties, the owner has to give permission. The owner™s permission 
typically takes the form of Right
-of
-Entry and Hold Harmless Agreements. The agreements 
are combined in one document. 
  Price gouging and
 other disaster issues (Consumer Protection and Better Business Bureau):
 o Announcements are made by the Attorney General.
 o Individuals can call or email the Attorney General™s Office if they suspect price gouging. 
  Contract reviews.
  Recovery. 
A catastrophic
 incident will require a very long recovery period. The amount and 
severity of damage sustained by the state will be the determining factor. The sooner the elements of 
long
-term recovery begin, the greater the likelihood of ensuring the continued viability
 of the damaged 
communities.
 After catastrophic damage, possible incentives for evacuees to return to their communities 
could include:
  Low interest loans to repair or replace homes and businesses.
  Fines and penalties for price gouging and/or unfair practic
es.
  Tax exemptions and/or reimbursements.
  The return of private industry and the employment opportunities it provides.
 Redevelopment and reconstruction is the rebuilding of the damaged areas, generating capital 
resources, setting priorities for outlays of 
recovery funds and preventing reinvestment in high
-risk areas. 
The state will impact redevelopment and reconstruction by:
  Making capital available to public and private investors in the damaged areas.
  Helping special governmental districts and general
-purp
ose governments to file and 
document insurance claims and applications for federal disaster grants and loans.
   2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
516
   Promoting coordination between the Federal Coordinating Officer, State Coordi
nating 
Officer, local governmental agencies, private service organiz
ations, and specific 
representatives of the private sector.
 Re
-establishment of government services will occur as state and local employees are called back 
to their customary assignments, emergency personnel are reassigned to their usual duties, and 
equipm
ent, records, supplies and furniture lost in the incident have been repaired or replaced.
 Evacuation 
 The mass evacuation that will follow some catastrophic events will require support on a much 
greater scale than the short term evacuations that typically 
occur in Arkansas. 
 In order for evacuation to be timely and effective, Arkansas™ plans consider the following:
  The conditions of pavements, bridges and access ramps.
  Fastest routes out of damaged areas into pre
-designated reception areas.
  Refueling statio
ns along evacuation routes. The ability to provide security and control traffic 
along the route. 
  Availability of mass transportation (i.e., school buses, commercial buses, trains, etc).
  Feasibility of air and water transportation as alternate means of tra
nsport.
  Feasibility of rapidly clearing or repairing damaged egress/ingress routes.
  Designation of Reception Areas (RAs) will be based on:
 o Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) between counties if they exist.
 o Ability of neighboring states, and the federal gover
nment to support host counties.
 o Ability of volunteer organizations to support host counties.
  Damage Assessment
 The Damage Assessment mission is much more complicated in a catastrophic earthquake. There 
will likely be exponentially more damage than in a mo
re typical disaster. At catastrophic levels of 
damage, Civil Air Patrol is tasked with air reconnaissance. Refer to Arkansas Wing Civil Air Patrol 
ﬁEarthquake Standard Operating Planﬂ dated April 15, 2019.
 The Damage Assessment mission will also be complic
ated after a widespread, severe pandemic. 
Infrastructure, and most manmade devices that support life as we know it, require constant 
maintenance. Damage caused by deferred maintenance 
- due to lack of maintenance personnel or 
  2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
517
  scarcity of spare parts 
- can™
t always be detected in a cursory inspection. Assessments and any repairs 
that must be made will occur much more slowly than what™s considered typical.
 Damage assessment after a catastrophic event will be more time consuming and information 
will be less re
liable than in a typical incident. What this means for emergency management is that 
response has to proceed more slowly and carefully than in an environment where there is reliable 
situation reporting.
 Debris Management
 A catastrophic incident, depending o
n its nature, can generate vast quantities of debris, posing 
an immediate threat to public health and safety due to fire, disease, and reduced access for emergency 
personnel and vehicles. Equally important, as debris is cleared, the volume of debris will s
train the ability 
to store, process, and dispose of the various materials in a safe and environmentally responsible 
manner.
 Massive quantities of debris will particularly overtask ESF #10 
Œ Oil and Hazardous Materials. 
The lead coordinating agency for ESF 
#10, Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality, has a long
-standing working relationship with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and other partners. 
These partners and assistance from other states will augment Arkansas™ debris management capabili
ty.
 To respond to a catastrophic earthquake, there will be working groups for function specific 
processes. 
  Removal of debris that hinders immediate lifesaving actions or poses an immediate threat to 
public health and safety. 
  Removal and disposal of debri
s that hinders the orderly recovery of the community and 
poses less immediate threats to health and safety. 
  Development of debris management strategies incorporating a program for recycling, reuse, 
and management of household hazardous wastes.
  Areas inund
ated with water or impacted by liquefaction will be approached as soon as it is 
operationally feasible to do so.
   Technical assistance will be available through ESF #10 and its partners.
  All responders to the Debris Management mission will be coordinated b
y ESF #10 to identify 
materials that are considered hazardous waste.
   2021 Catastrophic Incident Annex, Pg. 
518
  Even under catastrophic incident conditions, local, state, and federal responders must still 
obtain proper permits for debris disposal.
 Infrastructure Recovery
 Any number of possible cata
strophic scenarios involving infrastructure can be suggested. Major 
pipelines running through northeast Arkansas are particularly at risk for damage from a catastrophic 
earthquake. Significant, widespread damage has been done to the power grid over large a
reas of the 
state in past ice storms and a similar catastrophic event is certainly possible. Severe and prolonged 
drought conditions could do irreparable damage to Arkansas™ water resources. 
 Infrastructure issues are unique in that infrastructure typicall
y belongs to private rather than 
public entities. In these cases the state will take steps to support the private sector™s effort to restore 
the services that allow large groups of people to live close together.
 Evacuee Reception
 As much as possible, Arkan
sas will support affected citizens within the state. Arkansas Nuclear 
One event reception centers have been identified as possible evacuee reception points after 
catastrophic incidents. To support family reunification efforts and to help evacuees who can g
o to 
unaffected family for shelter, every ﬁjurisdiction sponsoredﬂ shelter in the state, including points of 
assembly within the affected area, will have a form of registration. Arkansas will also make use of online 
registration programs available from the
 American Red Cross and/or FEMA.
 First Responder Issues
 In any catastrophic incident, local first responders will be among the affected population and those who 
can respond will be quickly overwhelmed.

520  Introduction
  Situation 
 Detection of an intentional or unintentional contamination/adulteration of food, animals, 
plants, or a pest outbreak may occur in several different ways: 
  A terrorist attack on food or agriculture may initially be indistinguishable from a natu
rally 
occurring event; moreover, depending upon the particular agent and associated symptoms, 
several days could pass before public health, food, agriculture and medical authorities even 
suspect that terrorism may be the cause. In such a case, criminal int
ent may not be apparent 
until sometime after illnesses are recognized. 
  A devastating attack or the threat of an attack on the domestic animal population and plant 
crops through use of highly infective exotic disease or pest infestation could result in sev
ere 
economic loss. Early detection, allowing for early intervention, would come from agriculture 
expert authority reports as well as unusual patterns in surveillance systems. 
  A food or agricultural incident may affect international trade.

 If an agency becomes aware of an overt threat involving biological, chemical, or radiological 
agents or indications that i
nstances of disease may not be the result of natural causes, Arkansas State 
Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will be notified. The FBI, in turn, immediately 
notifies the National Operations Center (NOC) and the National Counterterrorism
 Center. 
 Participating State agencies may take appropriate independent emergency actions within the 
limits of their own statutory authority to protect the public, mitigate immediate hazards, and collect 
information concerning the emergency. This may requi
re deploying assets before they are requested via 
normal State EOC protocols. 
   2021 Food and Agriculture Incident Annex, Pg. 
521  Local governments are primarily responsible for detecting and responding to food and 
agriculture incidents and implementing measures to minimize the health and economic conseque
nces of 
such an incident or outbreak. 
 Planning Assumptions
 A food and agriculture incident may threaten public health, animal nutrition, food production, 
aquaculture, livestock production, wildlife, soils, rangelands, and agricultural water supplies. Resp
onding 
to the unique attributes of this type of incident requires separate planning considerations that are 
tailored to specific health and agriculture concerns and effects of the disease (e.g., deliberate 
contamination versus natural outbreaks, plant and 
animal versus processed food, etc.). Specific 
operational guidelines, developed by organizations with responsibility for the unique aspects of a 
particular disease or planning consideration, will supplement this annex and are intended as guidance to 
assist
 State, and local public health and agriculture authorities.
 The first evidence of dissemination of an agent will most likely be the presentation of disease in 
humans, animals, or plants; manifested either in clinical case reports to domestic or internatio
nal public 
health or agriculture authorities or in unusual patterns of symptoms or encounters within domestic or 
international human and animal health and crop production surveillance systems. 
 Food and agriculture surveillance systems will detect the pres
ence of a radiological, chemical, or 
biological agent and trigger directed environmental sampling and intensified human and animal 
surveillance to rule out or confirm a case. If a case is confirmed, then these systems will allow for 
mobilization of a publi
c health, medical, and law enforcement response in advance of the appearance of 
the first human and/or animal cases, or quick response after the first human and/or animal cases are 
identified. 
 A food and agriculture incident can be distributed across mult
iple jurisdictions simultaneously. 
Response to this type incident will require the simultaneous management of multiple ﬁincident sitesﬂ 
from national and regional headquarters locations in coordination with multiple State and local 
jurisdictions. 
 An act o
f food tampering or agro
-terrorism, particularly an act directed against large sectors of 
the industry within the United States, will have major consequences that can overwhelm the capabilities 
of many State and local governments to respond and may serious
ly challenge existing State response 
capabilities. 
   2021 Food and Agriculture Incident Annex, Pg. 
522  A food or agriculture incident can include biological, chemical, or radiological contaminants, 
which will require concurrent implementation of other State plans and procedures. 
 Concept of Operations
 Gene
ral 
 The key elements for an effective response to a food or agriculture incident include the 
following: 
  Rapid identification, detection, and confirmation of the incident. 
  Implementation of an integrated response to a food attack/adulteration, highly con
tagious 
animal/zoonotic, or exotic plant disease or plant pest infestation. 
  Identification of the human and animal population, and/or plants at risk. 
  Determination of how the agent involved was transmitted, including an assessment of the 
efficiency of tr
ansmission. 
  Determination of the public health and economic implications. 
  Control, containment, decontamination, and disposal. 
  Protection of the population(s) and/or plants at risk through appropriate measures. 
  Dissemination of information to advise th
e public of the incident.
  Communication with all relevant stakeholders. 
  Assessment of environmental contamination and extent of cleanup, decontamination, and 
disposal of livestock carcasses, plants, or food products involved. 
  Identification of the law en
forcement implications/assessment of the threat.
 Primary State functions include supporting local public health, food, and agriculture entities 
according to the policies and procedures detailed in this Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency 
Management Plan.
 Inci
dent Detection and Identification
 Determination of incident.
 Local authorities may be among the first to recognize the initial 
indication of intentional or naturally occurring contamination of food, of highly infective plant or animal 
disease, or of an eco
nomically devastating plant pest infestation or animal disease. Recognition may 
come from a significantly increased number of people reporting ill to public health care providers, 
increased reporting of sick animals to veterinarians or animal health offici
als, or numerous plant 
  2021 Food and Agriculture Incident Annex, Pg. 
523  anomalies reported by State officials or the public. Other sources may include routine laboratory 
surveillance, inspection reports, consumer complaint systems, and hotlines. Therefore, the most critical 
decision
-making support requir
es surveillance information, identification of the cause of the incident, a 
determination of whether the incident is intentional or naturally occurring, and the identification of the 
human or animal population and/or plants at risk. 
 Laboratory testing. 
Identification and confirmation of contaminated food or the environment, 
highly infective animals and plants, or an economically devastating plant pest infestation may occur 
through routine surveillance and laboratory testing. 
 The Arkansas Department of Agr
iculture houses several labs within its Laboratory Services 
Section. There is a chemical lab that tests for such substances as pesticides and residues. There is a seed 
lab which audits package contents against package labels. There is a petroleum products 
lab which tests 
samples of petroleum products for content and quality. There is a metrology lab which is the state 
standard for weights and measures.  The UA Division of Agriculture Cooperative Extension Service Plant 
Health Clinic in Fayetteville collabor
ates with the Plant Industries Division on plant disease diagnosis, as 
do selected Division of Agriculture scientists. 
 The Arkansas Department of Agriculture™s Laboratory Section also houses the Veterinary 
Diagnostic Laboratory, which assists the livestoc
k and poultry industries, private veterinarians, and 
animal owners of Arkansas by diagnosing and monitoring animal diseases that can affect humans, 
reduce the productivity or marketability of animals, threaten animal populations, and/or affect the 
safety o
r quality of animal products. The University of Arkansas, Division of Agriculture Leland E. Tollett 
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fayetteville, AR is also available for specific support of the Plant 
Industries Division as needed. 
 The laboratory also
 participates in federal cooperative disease programs and works with other 
state agencies to provide veterinary diagnostic testing, disease surveillance, animal health monitoring, 
drug testing, collaborative research, and animal health education.
 The Arkan
sas Department of Agriculture Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory is the only National 
Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) participant in the state, which allows the laboratory to test 
for Foreign Animal Diseases including Avian Influenza, Exotic Newcast
le Disease, Foot and Mouth 
Disease, etc.  
    2021 Food and Agriculture Incident Annex, Pg. 
524  Notification 
 A potential or actual incident requiring a coordinated State response involving contaminated 
food, infected animals or plants, or economically devastating plant pest infestation shall be brought to 
the immediate attention of the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM). 
ADEM will 
coordinate with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the United States Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), USDA APHIS, and other federal agencies as needed,
 and will coordinate with 
local/regional Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) to facilitate response activities.
  Actions
  The following steps are required to contain and control a food or agricultural incident: 
 1. Ensure the safety and security of the food an
d agricultural infrastructure in the affected 
area, as needed. 
 2. Inspect food facilities that can continue to operate in the affected area, as needed.
 3. Conduct laboratory tests to identify contaminated food, animals, or plants. 
 4. Conduct product trace back an
d trace forward investigations of identified food, animals, or 
plants. 
 5. Detain, seize, recall, or condemn affected food, animals, or plants. 
 6. State authorities will request approval from the EPA for the use of pesticides to 
decontaminate plants, animal fac
ilities, and food facilities from biological contaminants.

 Americans with Disabilities Act
   2021 Mass Evacuation Incident Annex, Pg. 
527  Introduction
  Policies
   According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, service animals are extensions of their 
owners and have the same a
ccess to public transportation as their owners at all times. 
  State departments, agencies, or divisions are responsible for developing evacuation plans 
for state facilities, including correctional facilities, hospitals, universities, offices and office 
bui
ldings, and other state owned or leased facilities.  These plans are coordinated with local 
jurisdictions.  
  State evacuation measures will be taken when local governments indicate that their 
resources may or have become overwhelmed and the County Judge, o
r designee by Judge™s 
proclamation, requests state assistance. State evacuation measures will also be taken after a 
catastrophic incident if local governments are incapacitated and the Governor directs state 
mass evacuation support.
  State assistance is sup
plied in support of a locally mandated mass evacuation.
  Planning Assumptions
   A catastrophic incident will cause significant disruption of the area™s critical transportation 
infrastructure, hampering evacuation operations. 
  Local jurisdictions have up to 
date Local Emergency Operations Plans (EOP) that contain 
information on transportation operations, debris and vehicle clearance, points of assembly, 
shelters, and other components of a mass evacuation and have ensured that these plans are 
shared. 
  Local go
vernments in affected areas, in conjunction with State authorities, will decide on the 
destinations for evacuees and will regulate the flow of transportation assets accordingly. 
  State agencies, working with local governments, have ensured that the leaders
hip of 
municipalities receiving evacuees from an impacted area agree to accept these individuals 
prior to evacuation. 
   2021 Mass Evacuation Incident Annex, Pg. 
528   Local governments recognize there is a substantial need to coordinate with State support 
agencies on population movement. 
  State resource
 requirements for a precautionary evacuation are based on the expected 
magnitude of the event. 
  State policies and guidelines governing companion animal evacuations are followed when 
incorporating companion animal issues into evacuations. 
  State agencies c
oordinate with local authorities to ensure synchronization between State 
actions and local emergency evacuation plans and requirements. 
  Residents of the evacuated area will return to the area post
-event. 
  Members of the functional needs population may req
uire additional support or assistance.
  Key Considerations
  Lead time required to conduct mass evacuations
. It may be necessary to begin evacuation as 
much as 72 hours prior to the expected beginning of the event. Resources may need to be mobilized as 
much
 as 48 hours prior to the start of evacuations to have sufficient capacity in place once the 
evacuation order is given. 
 Limits in weather forecasting capability
. The variables in forecasting track, intensity, and 
forward speed of tropical weather systems 
(the most likely and frequent reason for evacuations) make it 
extremely difficult for decision makers to commit costly resources as much as 5 days before the onset of 
tropical storm
-force winds for hurricanes and tropical storms. In some cases, storms at t
his stage are not 
sufficiently well formed to indicate the need for evacuation. No notice events do not allow forecasting 
to assist in preparation for a mass evacuation, i.e. earthquakes.  
 Interdependencies between shelters and transportation
. The transpo
rtation solution to a mass 
evacuation is based on the numbers of people needing evacuation, availability of transportation, 
numbers of evacuees with mobility and medical needs, the time available to conduct operations, and 
the distance to and availability 
of shelters. If shelters are located too far from embarkation points, 
transportation assets (buses, trains, and aircraft) cannot be recycled and may only make one trip during 
the operation. As a result, the distance traveled can reduce capacity to evacuate
 exponentially. It is 
critical to identify and pre
-designate shelters as close to the embarkation points as safely possible. The 
  2021 Mass Evacuation Incident Annex, Pg. 
529  designation and distance to household pet shelters or shelters that will accommodate pets are equally 
important to the success 
of an evacuation. 
 Needs of children
. It is critically important to recognize the needs of children during mass 
evacuations. In a no
-notice evacuation, children could be gathered in large numbers away from their 
parents, whether at schools, childcare facil
ities, summer camps, hospitals, or other locations. 
Reunification of children separated from their parents will be an issue during evacuation and 
consideration must be given to accomplishing this. The National Emergency Family Registry and Locator 
System (
NEFRLS) is addressed in the ESF #6 Annex. 
 Functional needs
 populations
. Accommodations will be made for the needs of all of the citizens 
of the affected area. These needs may include practical and/or functional assistance in communication, 
mobility, maint
aining independence, and medical care. 
 Animals
. The requirements for transporting and arranging for shelter and care of animals when 
they need to be relocated from their homes are of significant importance. There are special evacuation 
requirements for ea
ch category of animals: 
  Service animals.
 The ADA defines service animals as ﬁany dog that is individually trained to 
do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a 
physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or 
other mental disability. Under the ADA 
regulations, service animals have access to the same facilities as the humans they serve. 
  Companion animals.
 Planning for and accommodating household pets as a component of 
mass evacuations is critical. History demon
strates that many residents will refuse to 
evacuate or resist rescue if they are forced to leave their household pets behind. Therefore, 
without advance planning, the tracking, embarkation, transportation, care, feeding, and 
sheltering of household pets ca
n significantly impact the ability to safely evacuate the 
general population. The state will evacuate companion animals consistent with federal laws 
and with the terms and conditions of any relevant transportation contracts. 
 Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) I
ncidents
. Evacuation may occur in response to a large
-scale 
hazardous materials incident. Evacuation decision
-makers should consult with available HAZMAT 
officials as appropriate regarding the location of embarkation sites and evacuation routes. 
 Environme
ntal Contamination
. At the State level, all
-hazard HAZMAT assessment support is 
provided by ESF #10 
Œ Oil and Hazardous Materials Response. For radiological incidents, the State 
  2021 Mass Evacuation Incident Annex, Pg. 
530  coordinating agency for the incident under the Nuclear/Radiological Incident A
nnex will provide 
additional support to decision makers. 
 Victim Decontamination
. Local officials retain primary responsibility for victim screening and 
decontamination operations in response to a HAZMAT incident. Appropriate personnel and equipment 
must b
e available. Without appropriate decontamination and proof of decontamination, neighboring 
States/jurisdictions may resist accepting evacuees/patients. ESF #8 will coordinate state resources to 
use the standing decontamination capability effectively. 
 Even
ts with and without Warning
. The Concept of Operations applies to events for which there 
are warnings (e.g., hurricanes, flooding) as well as events for which there are no warnings (e.g., 
earthquake, industrial accident, terrorist attack). 
 Critical Infras
tructure
. A mass evacuation will present implications for many of the critical 
infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) sectors within the impacted areas. The evacuation will directly 
affect CIKR operations, supply lines, and/or distribution systems. The CI
KR Support Annex of the 
Arkansas Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan details the processes for expedited information 
sharing and analysis of impacts to CIKR. The annex offers recommendations and protocols to be used 
when considering incident
-related re
quests for assistance from CIKR owners and operators. 
  Concept of Operations
  Situation 
  The direction of evacuation operations is generally a local responsibility. However, there 
are response needs that exceed the capabilities of these jurisdictions to 
support mass 
evacuations. In instances where state support is required, ADEM will coordinate support with 
the local government. 
 When practical and possible, precautionary mass evacuation support will be provided to 
move citizens away from a potential inci
dent before or after an event, depending on the 
incident, when conditions are such that it is unsafe for citizens to remain in the area. 
    2021 Mass Evacuation Incident Annex, Pg. 
531  General
 Support to mass evacuation operations will be provided at the lowest possible level and scaled 
to the inciden
t. 
 Coordination and Communications 
 All facilities and related support necessary for operations are sourced by the State EOC through 
the ESFs. However, certain State agencies have independent authority to respond to an incident site 
directly after notific
ation of the incident. 
 Responsibilities
 Local governments
. Local governments have the primary responsibility and authority for 
evacuation planning and for the transportation, sheltering, public safety, and security of persons within 
their jurisdictions. 
 The Governor of the State of Arkansas. 
A.C.A. § 12
-75-107 charges the Governor with 
responsibility for declaring disaster emergency for the state as necessary. The declaration is the first 
step toward bringing the federal government™s resources into the ev
ent. It also obligates the state to 
pay a share of the cost of any federal assistance. A.C.A. § 12
-75-114 addresses the Governor™s other 
disaster emergency responsibilities and powers. 
 Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) as coordinating agenc
y. As in other 
events, ADEM™s role in mass evacuation is to communicate the needs of the local jurisdiction to entities 
capable of assisting. ADEM coordinates the available assistance to meet the need as efficiently and 
effectively as possible. ADEM also p
rovides situational awareness to stakeholders in the event, 
particularly the Governor. 
 Support Agencies.
 Supporting agencies have resources that may meet needs identified in this

   Introduction
 Purpose
  The purpose of this annex is to facilitate an effective State law enforcement and investigative 
response to all threats or acts of terrorism within the state, regardless of whether they are deemed 
credible. To accomplish this, the annex establishes a structure for a systematic, coordinated, unified, 
timely, and effective State law enforcement and inv
estigative response to threats or acts of terrorism 
within the state.
 Scope 
  Provides planning guidance and outlines operational concepts for the State law enforcement 
and investigative response to a threatened or actual terrorist incident within the state
.  Acknowledges and outlines the unique nature of each threat or incident, the capabilities and 
responsibilities of the local jurisdictions, and the law enforcement and investigative activities 
necessary to prevent or mitigate a specific threat or incident.
 Policies
  Arkansas regards terrorism as a potential threat to its security, as well as a violent 
criminal act, and applies all appropriate means to combat this threat. In doing so, the State 
vigorously pursues efforts to deter and preempt these crimes and
 to apprehend and prosecute 
directly, or assist foreign governments in prosecuting, individuals who perpetrate or plan 
terrorist attacks. 
 To ensure the policies established in applicable Presidential directives are implemented 
in a coordinated manner, thi
s annex provides overall guidance to State and local agencies 
concerning the law enforcement and investigative response to potential or actual terrorist 
threats or incidents that occur in Arkansas, particularly those involving weapons of mass 
destruction (
WMD),  chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high
-explosive (CBRNE) 
material. 
       2021 Terrorism Annex, 
Pg. 
536
   State Agencies
 Per Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5, ﬁThe Attorney General has lead responsibility for 
criminal investigations of terrorist acts or terror
ist threats by individuals or groups inside the United 
States, or directed at U.S. citizens or institutions abroad, where such acts are within the Federal criminal 
jurisdiction of the United States, as well as for related intelligence collection activities
 within the United 
States, subject to the National Security Act of 1947 and other applicable law, Executive Order 12333, 
and Attorney General approved procedures pursuant to that Executive order. Generally acting through 
the FBI, the Attorney General, in c
ooperation with other Federal departments and agencies engaged in 
activities to protect our national security, shall also coordinate the activities of the other members of 
the law enforcement community to detect, prevent, preempt, and disrupt terrorist att
acks against the 
United States. Following a terrorist threat or an actual incident that falls within the criminal jurisdiction 
of the United States, the full capabilities of the United States shall be dedicated, consistent with U.S. law 
and with activities
 of other Federal departments and agencies to protect our national security, to 
assisting the Attorney General to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice. The Attorney 
General and the Secretary shall establish appropriate relationships and mech
anisms for cooperation and 
coordination between their two departments.ﬂ
 That being said, the law enforcement and investigative response to a terrorist threat or incident 
within the State is a highly coordinated, multi
-agency event, involving not only Feder
al agencies, but 
State, county, and local government as well. In support of this mission, State agencies have primary 
responsibility for certain aspects of the overall law enforcement and investigative response (ref II.B. 
Concept of Operations, State Suppo
rt).
       2021 Terrorism Annex, 
Pg. 
537
   Deployment/Employment Priorities
 In addition to the priorities identified in the National Response Framework, the law 
enforcement and investigative response to terrorist threats or incidents is based on the following 
priorities:
  Preserving life or 
minimizing risk to health, which constitutes the first priority of operations
  Preventing a threatened act from being carried out or an existing terrorist act from being 
expanded or aggravated
  Locating, accessing, rendering safe, controlling, containing, re
covering, or disposing of a 
WMD that has not yet functioned, and disposing of CBRNE material in coordination with 
appropriate departments and agencies
  Apprehending and successfully prosecuting perpetrators of terrorist threats or activities
  Planning Assum
ptions and Considerations
 In addition to the planning assumptions and considerations identified in the National Response 
Framework, the law enforcement and investigative response to terrorist threats or incidents, 
particularly those involving WMD and CBRNE
 material, are based on the following assumptions and 
considerations:
  A terrorist threat or incident may occur at any time with little or no warning, may involve 
single or multiple geographic areas, may result in mass casualties and may involve varying 
deg
rees of property damage.
  The suspected or actual involvement of terrorists adds a complicating dimension to incident 
management.
  The response to a threat or actual incident involves law enforcement and investigative 
activity as an integrated element.
  In th
e case of a threat, there may be no incident site and no external consequences, 
therefore; there may be no need for establishment of traditional Incident Command System 
(ICS) elements such as an Incident Command Post (ICP) or the State Emergency Operations
 Center (SEOC).
  An act of terrorism, particularly an act directed against a large population center within the 
State involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials, will have major 
   2021 Terrorism Annex, 
Pg. 
538
   consequences that can overwhelm the capabilities of man
y county and local governments to 
respond and may seriously challenge existing State response capabilities.
  In the case of a biological attack, the effect may be consecutively and geographically 
dispersed, with no determined or defined ﬁincident site.ﬂ Res
ponse operations may be 
conducted over a multi
-jurisdictional, multi
-county region.
  A biological attack employing a contagious agent may require quarantine by State, county 
and local health officials to contain the disease outbreak.
  If appropriate personal
 protective equipment and capabilities are not available and the area 
is contaminated with CBRNE or other hazardous materials, it is possible that response 
actions into a contaminated area may be delayed until the material has dissipated to a level 
that is
 safe for emergency response personnel to operate or until appropriate personal 
protective equipment and capabilities arrive, whichever is sooner.
  Situation
 The complexity, scope, and potential consequences of a terrorist threat or incident require that 
there be rapid and decisive measures taken to resolve the situation. The resolution to an act of 
terrorism demands an extraordinary level of coordination of law enforcement, criminal investigation, 
protective activities, emergency management functions, and 
technical expertise across all levels of 
government. The incident may affect a single location or multiple locations, each of which may be an 
incident scene, a hazardous scene, and/or a crime scene simultaneously.
       2021 Terrorism Annex, 
Pg. 
539
   Concept of Operations
 General
 The FBI i
s the lead agency for criminal investigations of terrorist acts or terrorist threats and 
intelligence collection activities within the United States. Investigative and intelligence activities are 
managed by the FBI from an FBI command post or Joint Operati
ons Center (JOC). The command post or 
JOC coordinates the necessary Federal law enforcement assets required to respond to and resolve the 
threat or incident with other Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies.
 The FBI Special Agent in Cha
rge (SAC) of the local Field Office establishes a command post to 
manage the threat based upon a graduated and flexible response. This command post structure 
generally consists of three functional groups: Command, Operations, and Operations Support, and is
 designed to accommodate participation of other agencies, as appropriate.
 When the threat or incident exceeds the capabilities and resources of the local FBI Field Office, 
the SAC can request additional assistance from regional and national assets to augme
nt existing 
capabilities. In a terrorist threat or incident that may involve a WMD or CBRNE material, the traditional 
FBI command post will transition to a JOC, which may temporarily incorporate a fourth functional entity, 
the Consequence Management Group,
 in the absence of an activated JFO.
 When, in the determination of the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the 
Attorney General, the incident requires Federal coordination and a JFO is established, the JOC becomes 
a section of the JFO and 
a senior FBI official is appointed as the Senior Federal Law Enforcement Official 
(SFLEO) and participates as a representative in the Unified Coordination Group. The SFLEO may or may 
not be the SAC of the local Field Office. In this situation, the JOC Cons
equence Management Group is 
incorporated into the appropriate sections of the JFO.
 The JOC structure may also be used to coordinate law enforcement, investigative, and 
intelligence activities for the numerous special events, threats, or incidents that occu
r each year that do 
not escalate to incidents requiring DHS to coordinate the overall Federal response.

   Organization
 Terrorist events create a unique environment in which to manage emergency response.  Local 
responders are typically the first on
-scene du
ring an actual incident.  Local government has the primary 
responsibility for protecting public health and safety.  The local responders will manage all aspects of 
the incident until the FBI, by virtue of its legal authority, assumes command of the law enf
orcement 
aspects relating to identifying, apprehending, and neutralizing the terrorists and their weapons.  Local 
and state authorities always maintain control of their response resources and continue to operate while 
the FBI integrates into the on
-scene e
mergency management system.
 State Support
  The following state agencies have specific responsibilities during a terrorist related event in the 
state. In addition to the agencies listed below, there are other State entities that may have authorities, 
resour
ces, capabilities, or expertise required to support terrorism
-related law enforcement and 
investigation operations. These agencies may be asked to participate in planning and response 
operations and may be asked to designate liaison officers and provide ot
her support.
  Arkansas State Police (ASP). 
Œ ASP enforces Arkansas™s motor vehicle and criminal laws with 
a special focus upon identifying potential terrorist activity, criminal organizations, fugitives, 
and persons using Arkansas highways to transport ille
gal drugs, weapons, or perpetrating 
other types of crimes. Additionally, ASP maintains a position on the JTTF to assist with 
terrorism intelligence and anti
-terrorism planning. The following summarizes ASP™s 
responsibilities during a terrorist event:
 o Under
 emergency response conditions ASP will respond to protect life and property 
when actions to cope with the situation exceed local government capabilities, when 
assistance is requested by local officials, or when local troopers become involved in the 
situat
ion.
 o Upon notification of a potential or actual situation ASP will notify ADEM.
 o ASP personnel will control traffic to allow only authorized personnel and equipment into 
the incident area.  
 o ASP will establish an Arkansas State Police Incident Command Post 
to communicate with 
all ASP units assigned, ADEM personnel, and Arkansas National Guard units if activated.

 o Coordinate response functions of state government.  This coordination will include 
liaison with federal agencies, local agencies and private entities.
 o  Obtain and coordinate needed resources.
 o Notify all involved agen
cies and will maintain contact as needed for coordination of the 
event.  This will include periodic updates for the duration of the event.
 o Assist and coordinate in the training, planning and preparedness efforts of counter 
terrorism statewide.
   Arkansas Na
tional Guard (NGAR) 
- Under Title 10 and 32 provisions, the National Guard 
could react to a Terrorist/WMD incident. The NGAR has numerous assets that could be used 
during a terrorist incident. The following summarizes NGAR actions during a terrorist 
incide
nt:

Teams (WMD
-CST) is to support local and s
tate authorities at domestic WMD incident 
sites by identifying agents and substances, assessing current and projected 
consequences, advising on response measures, and assisting with requests for 
additional military support. 
  Arkansas Department of Health (
ADH) 
Œ ADH supplies public health services during/after a 
terrorist incident to include drinking water analysis and bioterrorism 
research/decontamination. The following summarizes ADH™s responsibilities during a 
terrorist related incident:

  Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment, Division of Environmental Quality (DEQ) 
Œ DEQ performs air, water, solid waste, and hazardous waste analysis during 
terrorism 
incidents. 
    2021 Terrorism Annex, 
Pg. 
544
   There are numerous state associated law enforcement entities which support FBI operations 
during a terrorism incident. In addition to state, county, and local law enforcement organizations, there 
are agencies that support and supply i
nformation to the field:
  Arkansas State Fusion Center 
Œ provides vital service to identify and assess threats that may 
impact the State. Also serves as a source of intelligence information necessary for anti
-terrorist operations planning and as an investig
ative asset during post
-terrorism incidents. A 
fusion center is an effective and efficient mechanism to exchange information and 
intelligence, maximize resources, streamline operations, and improve the ability to fight 
crime and terrorism by merging data f
rom a variety of sources. In addition, fusion centers 
are a conduit for implementing portions of the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan 
(NCISP). Their ultimate goal is to provide a mechanism where law enforcement, public 
safety, and private partne
rs can come together with a common purpose and improve the 
ability to safeguard our homeland and prevent criminal activity.
  Joint Terrorism Task Force 
Œ state and local law enforcement assets are teamed with federal 
organizations in this FBI sponsored orga
nization. The members are charged with acting 
against terrorism by preventing acts of terrorism before they occur, and to effectively and 
swiftly respond to any actual criminal terrorist act by identifying and prosecuting those 
responsible.
 Response
 Receip
t of a terrorist threat may be through any source or medium and may be articulated or 
developed through intelligence sources. It is the responsibility of all local, State, and Federal agencies 
and departments to notify the FBI when such a threat is receive
d. As explained below, the FBI evaluates 
the credibility of the terrorist threat and notifies the NOC, NCTC, and other departments and agencies, 
as appropriate.
 Upon receipt of a threat of terrorism within the United States, the FBI conducts a formal threa
t credibility assessment in support of operations with assistance from select interagency experts. For a 
WMD or CBRNE threat, this assessment includes three perspectives:
  Technical Feasibility: An assessment of the capacity of the threatening individual or
 organization to obtain or produce the material at issue.
    2021 Terrorism Annex, 
Pg. 
545
    Operational Practicability: An assessment of the feasibility of delivering or employing the 
material in the manner threatened.
  Behavioral Resolve: A psychological assessment of the likelihood that t
he subject(s) will 
carry out the threat, including a review of any written or verbal statement by the subject(s).

  Executive Summary
 The emergence of COVID
-19 has presented significant challenges 
for the 
State of Maine. After 
detecting its first case of COVID
-19 in March 2020, Maine activated its entire public health 
infrastructure to quickly identify, investigate, and isolate COVID
-19 cases. While responding to 
the emerg
ing
 virus through testing, 
personal protective equipment (
PPE) distribution, and contact 
tracing, Maine also began its planning for the eventual approval of a vaccine (or vaccines) for the 
prevention of COVID
-19.  This d
ocument is the result of Maine™s initial planning efforts.
 Given the significant number of unknowns around any vaccine(s) that are eventually approved, 

this document is necessarily one that will evolve as additional information 
emerges
.  The State of 
Maine will update the document as more is learned 
about
 manufacturing, storage, 
efficacy
 in 
different groups, dosing schedules, as well as other factors that will affect the implementation of 

vaccine on a large scale. 
It will also evolve with additional input from 
health care providers, 
communities in Maine, and the public.
 Version 
1, posted on Oct
ober 16, 2020, will be updated
. In general, Maine will use three principles to guide its approach to 
COVID
-19 vaccination:
 1. Equity
: COVID
-19 has not affected all groups in Maine equally.  
Some groups
Šsuch as 
racial and ethnic minorities
Šhave experienced rates of disease that far exceed their 
representation in the population as a whole.  Other groups, such as 
seniors
Šespecially 
those who live in congregate care settings
Šhave experienced sign
ificant mortality 
associated with COVID
-19.  And individuals with serious chronic medical conditions 
have experienced disproportionate morbidity from COVID
-19.  As part of its planning, 
Maine intends to make health equity a central focus of its effort.
 2. Acc
ess
ibility
: Maine
™s planning effort is focused on making COVID
-19 vaccine 
accessible to all Maine people. Maine 
has actively engaged with health care providers of 

all types, in all areas of the state, to make vaccine as easily available as possible. 
For 
certain populations, 
such as front
-line health care workers and first responders, Maine is 
working directly with hospitals to provide the vaccine at those 
workplaces
.  For other 
groups, such as those who live in congregate care settings, 
Maine is working with 
health 

care providers who may be able to go on site 
and vaccinate residents to reduce the need 

for travel. 
 3. Flexibility: 
Given
 the number of questions that remai
n about 
the vaccines themselves, 
their efficacy in different populations, the schedule of doses, cold
-chain storage 
requirements, as well as data, reporting, and monitoring, Maine™s COVID
-19 plan is 
flexible by design.  As new information and guidance beco
me available, our plan will be 

updated to reflect the latest available information.  
We will also maintain that same 

flexible approach with respect to vaccination 
prioritization and distribution 
itself. 
 Maine is committed to a COVID
-19 vaccine 
planning and implementation process that 
furnishes 
the vaccine
 to Maine people in a timely, equitable fashion.

  Section 1: 
COVID
-19 Vaccination 
Preparedness Planning
 A. Describe 
you
r early 
COVID
-19 vaccination program planning activities
, includ
ing
 lessons 
learned 
and improvements made 
from 
the 2009 
H1N1 
vaccination 
campaign
, seasonal 
influenza campaigns,
 and other responses
 to identify gaps in preparedness
.  In anticipation of a COVID
-19 vaccine, 
the 
Maine 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
(Maine 
CDC
) began
 COVID
-19 vaccination planning activities 
in the 
spring of 2020. 
We began
 by determining preliminary
 objectives, 
key 
stakeholders, and
 gaps.  Maine
 CDC 
then
 started building
 a foundation for 
communicating to 
stakeholders
 and 
for initial response 
activities such as 
planning 
physical 
dist
ancing guidance 
for promoting
 childhood
 vaccine
s.    Initially
, the Maine 
CDC 
Immunization Program (MIP)
 worked with partners to identify 
steps
 that
 could be taken to mitigate 
the impact of 
vaccine
-preventable diseases (
VPD
) in 
the 
absence of a C
OVID
-19 vaccine.  MIP and 
its 
partners focused on 
promoting
 routine 
vaccination
s to limit 
the 
concurrent 
spread of VPDs
 other than COVID
-19. MIP also 
monitored vaccine 
order
s to identify possible gaps in vaccination coverage.
  MIP collaborated with partners to encourage vaccination and provided guidance on safe 
vaccination during the pandemic.  
Specifically, MIP held weekly c
onference
 calls
, which
 included p
ediatricians
, family
 physicians, h
ospital 
systems
, Tribal 
liaison
s, the 
Maine CDC 
Public
 Health Nursing program
, state and local 
emergency 
management
 agencies,
 and 
community 
vaccinators
.  Our focus 
expanded 
from initially addressing 
concerns 
of 
vaccinating with confidence during a pandemic
 to eventually encompassing
 COVID
-19 vaccine planning efforts. 
 Providers reported s
uccess
 stories of 
curbside clinics
 and
 tele
-health well
-child visits and follow
-up appointment for vaccin
ation
, to the promotion
 of 
influenza vaccine and now COVID
-19 vaccine planning efforts
.  Utilizing
 guidance from 
the 
U.S. 
CDC for 
physical 
distancing
, we updated our 
School
-Located Vaccine Clinic 
Toolkit and created a Community Vaccination Tool
kit. 
(Appendix A)
 In the fall
, our 
efforts focus
ed on expanding influenza vaccination
 rates across Maine
. MIP™s 
vaccinating campaign for 
the 
2020-2021 flu season 
includes a specific 
emphas
is on 
vaccinating the entire family and people at higher risk for flu and 
COVID
-19 infections.  
The 
U.S. 
CDC routinely
 provides pediatric influenza vaccine doses to the state through their 
Vaccines 
For Children program. This year they have also allocated the State of Maine an 
additional 94,000 flu doses to target adult populations. This will create an opportunity for 
medi
cal providers to vaccinate parents and any family member accompanying pediatric 
patients without the concern of cost to the family.
 Since MIP has a limited number of adult vaccination providers, MIP is currently recruiting 
providers 
who
 can
 provide influen
za vaccine to adults
, especially in Long
-Term Care 
Facilities (LTCF) and other providers that 
serve 
high
-risk populations.  Once these new 
 Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    5 | Page
  providers are on board, MIP plans to 
partner with them to furnish COVID
-19 vaccination
, once 
such a 
vaccine is available.   
 Simultaneously, MIP is laying groundwork to connect Maine™s electronic immunization 
information system (
IIS
), with 
the U.S. 
CDC™s IZ Gateway, a national platform that allows 
the 
sharing of vaccine administration data between states
. This 
linkage 
will be vital for 
COVID
-19 vaccination 
data collection, sharing, and analysis.  
 The 
lessons learned from H1N1 
vaccination 
efforts have 
guided 
current planning efforts.  
Specifically, Maine CDC is focused on ensuring 
that 
partnerships
 with health care providers, 
schools, and other public health entities contribute to the successful campaign and 
become 
a valuable resource for future vaccine campai
gns. Key partners include hospitals, health 
centers, school administrators and staff, school nurses, visiting nursing associations, EMS, 

other health care providers and practices, 
Maine CDC 
Public Health Nurses, 
Maine CDC 

District Public Health 
Liaisons
, Maine CDC Vaccine Coordinators assigned to each public 
health district, emergency management agencies (county, state, municipal), municipal health 

departments, volunteers (including EMS and those who registered with Maine Responds), 

District
 Coor
dinating Councils 
for 
Public Health
,  Healthcare Coalitions
, the community, and 
other public health entities throughout the state.
  During 
mass vaccination efforts around the 
H1N1
 novel influenza virus,
 it was noted that 
sometimes vaccine was shipped to a location, such as a hospital pharmacy, where staff had 
not been involved in vaccine planning and coordination. We have 
surveyed our 
hospital
 systems 
and have collected point of contact information as we
ll as capacity
 and storage 
capabilit
y information on all such facilities
.  Also, the after
-action review of H1N1 efforts 
revealed that, w
hen 
H1N1 
vaccine was in limited supply, vaccinators felt pressure from those 
in the larger priority groups who were not immediately prioritized. For example, many health 
care workers made compelling arguments for being vaccinated early as they were in one of 
the la
rge priority groups. However, health care workers were prioritized primarily to keep 
them from spreading disease to patients. Therefore, only health care workers exposed to the 

highest risk patients were initially prioritized. These distinctions were diffi
cult to 

communicate to the public as well as those delivering vaccine. 
Individuals 
expressed 
concerns about the number of otherwise healthy health care workers and first responders 

receiving vaccine when they and their family members at high risk for compl
ications from 
H1N1 could not access vaccine.
 Maine is utilizing information collected in the Hospital 
System S
urvey to determine 
the 
number of 
health care workers 
who 
may be 
prioritized
, with 
the assumption that 
available 
vaccine will not be able to 
meet the demand to vaccinate all 

individuals

   E. Describe 
how your jurisdiction will
 coordinate efforts
 between state
, local
, and territorial
 authorities
. Maine 
enjoys strong communication and linkages with other states, as well as among 
localities within the 
state.  Maine intends to ensure visibility and insight into its planning and 
rollout through regularly scheduled meetings and briefings wi
th those parties.
 For other states, Maine is an active participant in the Association of State and Territorial 

Health Officials (ASTHO), which convenes regular calls and meetings to discuss the 

progress of vaccine planning and rollout.  
For example
, ASTHO has recently held meetings 
focused on strategies to provide vaccine coverage 
and ensure uptake in rural states, such as 
Maine.  
 Maine also participates in the Association of Immunization Managers (AIM), which 
convenes similar meetings. AIM provide
s immunization managers a forum to share best 
practices on tactical implementation of vaccine strategies.
  Our intention is to continue active 
participation in both organizations 
to coordinate our efforts among different state, local, and 
territorial entit
ies.
 Maine has also participated in
 COVID
-19 vaccine planning discussions organized by the 
National Governors Association.

  External meetings, communications to organizations
 F. Describe how your jurisdiction will engage and coordinate efforts with leadership from 
Tribal
 communities, 
Tribal
 health organizations, and urban Indian organizations.
  MIP has an ongoing relationship with 
the five fe
derally
 recognized 
Tribes in Maine.  
In 
addition to the routine VFC program site visits, the 
MIP 
Senior Health Program Manager and 
the embedded 
federal
 Public Health Advisor meet with 
leadership and staff from the 
Tribal
 health 
centers
 at least once a year to discuss issues a
nd identify 
ways that MIP can better 
support
 Tribal
 communities.  
  
In addition to continuing routine interactions, Maine will engage 
with all five 
Tribal
 governments 
to discuss 
COVID
-19 vaccine planning. The 
planning
 team that will work with 
the five 
Tribal
 governments
 in Maine will 
include
 Maine DHHS
 Clinical Advisor
 Lisa 
Letourneau
, M.D.;
 the Tribal Public Health District Liaison
; and the federal Public Health 
Advisor
, who has spent more than 10 years working with In
dian Health Service
 (IHS
) and 
Tribal
 programs
.  
Trib
al governments
 will be given the option to obtain 
a COVID
-19 vaccine 
supply 
through 
the 
Indian Health Service or through 
the 
state 
of Maine
.  At 
this 
time, 
Tribal
 entities 
in Maine 
have not yet had to make this decision.  However, regardless of the decision made by 
Tribes, 
the 
state 
of Maine is committed to assisting 
them 
with all aspects of 
COVID
-19 vaccine 
planning and administration
.  MIP will assist 
Tribal organizations with communications, 
technical assistance, and questions they may have regarding the vaccine regardless 
of 

whether 
Tribes receive vaccine from the 
state
 of Maine
 or IHS.

  Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID
-19 Vaccination
 A. Describe how your jurisdiction will structure the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program around 
the three phases of vaccine administration:
 Phase 1: 
Potentially
 Limited 
Doses 
Available
 U.S.
 CDC anticipates 
Phase 
1 to begin 
as early as 
November 2020 and to last approximately 
six weeks.  
Maine intends to 
largely 
follow the priorit
y group detailed by the National 
Academy of Science, 
Engineering, and Science 
(see
 Appendix E)
. Maine
 CDC will need to 
identify subgroups to vaccinate in the first phase
 if vaccine supply is limited
. As noted in 
Appendix E, Phase 1 will thus be divided into two sub
-phases: 1(a) and 1(b). 
Phase 1(a)
 will 
likely be healthcare workers providing direct pa
tient care in high risk settings and others who 
work in critical infrastructure as well as those working and living in long
-term care facilities. 
Vaccination of these target groups will occur in closed
, point
-of-dispensing
 (POD) 
settings 
with the 
health 
care 
systems throughout Maine. 
 Even though vaccine supply will 
likely
 be limited, vaccine will be ship
ped
 in relatively large 
quantities in relation to storage capacity of many of our current vaccinators.  One of the 
presentations will ship in 100 dose increments and needs to be stored at 
-20 degrees Celsius 
and the other will be shipped in 1,000 dose increme
nts and will need to be stored 
-70 degrees 
Celsius
.  Maine
 CDC will work with the 
health
 care 
systems 
and
 pre
-identify facilities 
with 
the 
capabilit
y to safely store the vaccine to serve as receiving and redistribution points for the 
vaccine. 
If vaccine needs to be redistributed 
District Liaisons will assist 
Health Care 
Coalitions
 to coordinate vaccine transfer to vaccination sites or to P
ublic Health 
Nursing 
and 
the Emergency Medical S
ervices 
for Strike Team use.  (Vaccine transfers will be 
document
ed in the Maine Immunization Information System
 in the same 
manner
 that
 routine 
vaccination transfers are documented)
. Vaccinators should plan 
to 
administer vaccine 
within
 a few days
 of receipt
 to ensure the 
vaccine viability. Vaccination settings in 
Phase 
1 will likely include closed PODs in the 

healthcare settings for highest priority healthcare workers, closed 
PODs 
and/
or strike teams 
at long term care facilities and closed 
PODs
/ strike teams for highest priority critical 
infrastructure.
 Phase 2: Large 
Number of 
Doses 
Available, 
Supply 
Likely to 
Meet 
Demand
 Phase
 2 will 
begin
 in when vaccine supply is sufficient to vaccinate more broadly and with 
the expectation to reach surge capacity efforts. M
aine
 CDC will continue 
to 
vaccinate by 
priority 
group
 and
 begin using mass vaccination strategies such as open PODs in community 
settings, 
school 
located 
vaccination 
clinics
, and 
possibl
y curbside clinic
s. District Liaisons
, Health Care Coalitions
 and a Maine Immunization Program Public Health Educator 
will have
  Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    20 | Page
  an increased role in 
Phase 
Two.  All
 will work together to coordinate mass vaccination 
efforts
, including communication to the public and logistics of the clinics.
 Additional vaccine 
distribution sites including Federally Qualified Health Centers, and 
Private and Public
 Providers will start to receive vaccine in anticipation 
of assist
ing
 with vaccination efforts.
 Phase 3: Likely 
Suff
icient
 Supply
, Slowing Demand
 Phase
 3 is expected 
to start
 once groups 
in Phase 1
 and
 Phase 2 
have had the opportunity to 
be vaccinated.  At this point, 
COVID
-19 vaccination efforts will transition to routine 
vaccination and will be conducted through traditional means.  By this time
, pharmacies will 
likely be able to vaccinate against 
COVID
-19.  Th
is is especially helpful in reaching 
individuals that live in rural setting with limited access to 
tradition
al healthcare facilities.  
Mass vaccination efforts will continue in 
Phase 
3 if they are still needed.

 A. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to: 1) identify, 2) estimate numbers of, and 3) locate 
(e.g., via mapping) critical populations. Critical population groups may include:
 COVID
-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about 
the 
impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness 
from COVID
-19.  Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions 
might be at an increased risk
 for severe illness from COVID
-19:   Asthma 
(moderate
-to-severe
)  Cerebrovascular 
Disease (
affects 
blood vessels and blood 
supply 
to the brain
)  Cystic 
Fibrosis
  Hypertension 
(or high

  Pulmonary Fibrosis (
having 
damaged or scarred lung tissues
)  Smoking
  Thalassemia 
(a type of blood 
disorder
)  Type 
1 Diabetes Mellitus
 People of any age with the following conditions 
are at increased risk
 of severe illness 
from COVID
-19:   Cancer
  Chronic kidney disease
  COPD (chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease
)  Immunocompromised state 

(weakened immune system) from

s if there is
 insufficient vaccine supply
.   Maine will be seeking guidance from 
specific, topical working groups 
for recommendations 
for narrowing the subset groups of the critical population 
if there is insufficient vaccine 
supply.
  D. Describe how your jurisdiction will establish points of contact (POCs)
 and communication 
methods
 for organization
s, employer
s, or communi
ties
 (as appropriate) within the critical 
population groups.
   Initial points of contacts will be 
collected through 
the

  Section 5: COVID
-19 Provider Recruitment and Enrollment
 A. Describe how your jurisdiction is currently recruiting or will recruit and enroll COVID
-19 vaccination providers and the types of settings to be utilized in the COVID
-19 Vaccination 
Program for each of the previously described phases of vaccine availability, including the 
process to verify that providers are credentialed with active, valid licen
ses to possess and 
administer vaccine.
 Hospitals
:  Maine has a total of 37 hospitals
 operating 
within
 one of three
 large 
healthcar
e system
s; several independent critical access hospitals
; and three psychiatric inpatient 
facilities.
 Several of these facilities are 
currently
 enrolled in the 
VFC 
program. 
The Maine 
Immunization Program is
 actively engag
ed with all the
se hospital facilities
, holding 
weekly 
COVID
-19 Phase 1 Vaccine 
Planning conference call
s during which 
we make available the 
most recent 
U.S.
 CDC updates
, including a review of the COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider 
Agreement
 and
 enrollment 
requirement
s. We anticipate enrolling all 37 Maine hospitals as 
COVID
-19 Vaccine Provide
r sites
 as a priority for Phase 1.
  Long
-term care facilities
:  Utilizing the adult influenza supplemental funding, 
the 
Maine
 Immunization Program
 sent communications to all licensed long
-term care facilities in the 
state to actively recruit
 and 
enroll 
them in the 
Maine Immunization Program, 
and offer 

supplemental influenza vaccine to these non
-traditional congregate living facilities
, and 
several 
have already enrolled, or begun the proce
ss of enrolling.
  These sites will be 
encouraged to enroll to be a COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider site as well.
  Long
-term care 
facilities that do not have the capacity for storage and handling of vaccines,
 or those who 
have 
very 
few employees or residents
, have been noted as candidates for ﬁstrike teamsﬂ. 
 These strike teams will be comprised of Maine Public Health Nursing staff and Maine EMS 
staff to provide on
-site vaccination services.
 Long
-term care fac
ilities will be prioritized for 
Phase 1 vaccination efforts.
  
Pharmacies
:  The Maine Immunization Program is actively engaged with the Maine 
Pharmacy
 Association to discuss enrolling 
all Maine pharmacies as COVID
-19 Vaccine 
Provider sites. 
These
 pharmac
y sites will be used
 as a mechanism to reach long
-term care 
facilities 
unable to meet the COVID
-19 enrollment requirements 
during Phase 1 and the 
general public for subsequent phases. 
Verifying the licensure of pharmacists who participate 
in vaccination efforts will be done via the 
Maine Board of Pharmacy.
  Indian Health 
Service
:  Maine has fi
ve Tribal
 health centers
 in 
the state
, and a
ll five 
locations are enrolled in the VFC program. A
ll five locations are represented under one 
public health district. The 
District Liaison 
and 
a representative 
from each location are 

included in our weekly COVID
-19 Vaccine 
Phase 
One 
planning calls and are receiving 
 Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    27 | Page
  enrollment information as it is available. 
MIP
 anticipate
s enrolling
 these sites under Phase 1 
if they do not receive vaccine under direct allocation from the 
U.S.
 CDC.
  Mobile 
vaccination providers
:  The Maine 
Immunization Program
 currently has several 
providers enrolled in the VFC program to conduct annual influenza clinics for 
Maine school 

age children 
in the elementary school setting
s and large
-scale community 
settings.
 MIP
 is actively engaged in enrolling these providers as COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider sites to utilize 
their efforts during the general public phases of COVID
-19 vaccine distribution. 
  
Occupation
al health setting for large employers
:  The Maine Immunization Program
 has 
reviewed 
the
 H1N1 provider list to obtain historical information for 
large employers in the 
state that offered influenza clinics for their employees. 
MIP
 will also collaborate with 
the 
Maine Department of Labor to obtain a list of the largest employer
s in the state. 
Through 
communications and outreach, we plan to 
engage this group of
 sites 
for enrollment during 
Phases 2
-4, prioritizing based on the high
-risk nature of employment.
  
Federally qualified health centers
, rural health centers, 
physicians™
 offices
, etc.
:  Most 
FQHCs
 and 
physicians™
 offices that provide pediatric care in the 
state 
of Maine are enrolled 
as VFC providers in the Maine Immunization Program. We 
will ensure 
this group of 

traditional primary health care settings are informed of the COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider 
enrollment requirements and will 
begin enrolling these sites durin
g Phase 2.
  
Urgent Care Clinics
: Given that urgent care clinics have been accessible to the public 
throughout the pandemic, the Maine Immunization Program envisions enrolling them as 

COVID
-19 Vaccine Providers.
  
Other locations
:  The Maine Immunization 
Program 
will ensure that all locations not 
addressed above be given the ability to enroll 
as COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider
s if they meet 
the requirements of the provider agreement. These other settings include colleges, 

correctional faci
lities, homeless shelters, dialysis centers, etc. These locations will be 
prioritized based on the high
-risk populations that they serve.
  
Maine Immunization Program staff 
will review a
ll COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider Agreements 
to ensure that each site meets 
the requirements of enrollment prior to receiving vaccine. 
 This 

will include a review of 
signatures, storage and handling capabilities, and potential vaccine 

administration need. 
Staff will check each provider listed under the prescribing provider 

section against the 
appropriate 
State of 
Maine 
licensing board roster
 to ensure that they hold 
an active Maine license and can legally prescribe vaccine in the 
state 
of Maine.  COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider Agreements will not be approved unless all sections are complete and 
after 
a review of medical licenses is done.
    Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    28 | Page
  B. Describe how your jurisdiction will determine the provider types and settings t
hat will
 administer the first 
available COVID
-19 vaccine doses to
 the critical population groups 
listed in Section 4.
 The 
Maine Immunization
 Program
 will prioritize 
enrollment of
 hospitals and long
-term care 
facilities 
and pharmacies
 throughout the state to ensure that Maine healthcare
 personnel and 
long
-term care residents in Phase 1 receive COVID
-19 vaccine when available. 
A survey was 
sent to hospitals 
to ascertain their total healthcare personnel numbers and their high
-risk 
employee population. 
In the event that vaccine is allocated
 in small doses and not all healthcare 
employees can be vaccinated with the first round of vaccine shipments, we 
asked
 that 
the
 hospital employee
 high
-risk population 
be broken down into emergency department staff, ICU 
staff, and 
required any other high
-risk staff to be listed by department.
  The Maine COVID
-19 Vaccine Planning Committee will make the determination of which departments to prioritize 
based on federal vacci
ne allotments.
 All other enrollments will be prioritized by the anticipated popu
lation phases they may be 

serving.
 C. Describe how provider enrollment data will be collected and compiled to be reported 

electronically to 
U.S. 
CDC twice weekly, using a 
U.S. 
CDC
-provided Comma Separated 
Values (CSV) or JavaScript (JSON) template via a SAMS
-authenticated mechanism.
  The Maine
 Immunization Program will require each COVID
-19 vaccine site to complete a 
fillable PDF form of the COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider Agreement
, both sections A and B. 
When enrollment forms are 
received,
 they will be entered into Microsoft Power App
. Maine 
CDC 
will provide the 
U.S. 
CDC twice
-weekly CSV files on the number of provider
 sites 
enrolled, and any other provider agreement data reporting elements required.
 D. Describe the process your jurisdiction will use to verify that providers are 
credentialed with 
active, valid licenses to possess and administer vaccine.
 For each
 COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider 
Agreement received,
 Maine Immunization Program 
staff will check each provider listed under the prescribing provider section against the 
appropriate State of 
Maine 
licensing board
 to ensure that they hold an active Maine license 

and can legally prescribe vaccine in the 
state 
of Maine. 
 CDC COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider 
Agreements will not be approved un
til a review of medical licenses is done.
  E. Describe how your jurisdiction will 
provide
 and track training 
for
 enrolled providers
 and list
 training
 topics.
  For enrolled VFC providers, the Maine Immunization Program requires that the primary and 
secondary vaccine coordinators receive training on 
all 
program
 requirements, storage and handling 
best practices, and 
our Immunization Information System, 
IIS
. Maine
 CDC
 plans to mirror this 
 Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    29 | Page
  process for COVID
-19 Vaccine Providers. 
 Through the use of a 
U.S. 
CDC
-provided training 
program, such as 
ﬁYou Call the Shots
ﬂ, or a
n internally
 developed 
training program
, we will 
require that each site vaccine coordinator has re
ceived training prior to vaccine being distributed to 
the site.
 The Maine Immunization Program will be utilizing 
the 
Microsoft Power App as our primary 

mechanism for tracking the COVID
-19 Vaccine 
Provider Agreements
 and that required training 
has been completed
.  F. Describe how your jurisdiction will approve planned redistribution of COVID
-19 vaccine 
(e.g., health systems or commercial partners with depots, smaller vaccination providers 

needing less than the minimum or
der requirement).
  Maine is requiring that 
every
 COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider complete both sections A and B of the 
Agreement
, including those sites with 
a health system 
or parent organization
. Additionally, we will 
enroll every COVID
-19 vaccine provider site
 into our IIS
. Any redistribution 
from organization to 
site, or from site to site, 
will follow our current VFC protocols for vaccine transfer. Both primary 

and secondary locations 
are
 required to be active sites
, have current acceptable vaccine storage 
temperatures recorded in 
IIS
 within the past 24 hours
, and have reconciled their vacci
ne inventory 
within the past two weeks
. All transfers
 will 
be completed electronically 
using the IIS. This not 
only ensures that 
cold chain is maintained, but that we can have administration data at the site 

location, 
versus the
 organization level.
 G. Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure there is equitable access to COVID
-19 vaccination services throughout all areas within your jurisdiction.
 Maine CDC has 
established 
a group of external stakeholders who meet on a regular basis to plan 
for an event
ual 
COVID
-19 vaccine. 
Soon
, there may also be 
specific working groups
 comprising 
additional stakeholders.  
These
 could
 include
 Dr. Shah in his capacity as
 state 
health official
; representation from local chapters of the A
merican 
Academy of Pediatrics
, American 
Academy of 
Family 
Practitioners
, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
; and other healthcare 
officials 
throughout the state. 
Working
 group
s will review recommendations from the A
dvisory 
Committee of 
Immunization 
Practices
 and 
U.S. 
CDC regarding target populations for vaccine 
distribution and 
advise 
MIP
 on vaccine distribution, ensuring allocation and access is equitable.
   H. Describe how your j
urisdiction plans to recruit and enroll pharmacies not served directly by 
the U.S. 
CDC and their role in your COVID
-19 Vaccination Program plans.
 MIP
 is 
working
 with the Maine Pharmacy Association 
to enroll
 all Maine pharmacies as 
COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider sites. These pharmacy sites will be used as a mechanism to 
reach long
-term care facilities unable to meet the COVID
-19 enrollment requirements during 
Phase 1 and the general public for subsequent phases.

  Section 6: COVID
-19 Vaccine Administration Capacity
 A. Describe how your jurisdiction has or will estimate vaccine administration capacity based on 
hypothetical planning scenarios provided previously.
 B. Describe how your jurisdiction will use this information 
to inform provider 
recruitment
 plans.
  As well as conferring with professional organizations to determine their members
™ vaccination capacity, MIP will also utilize the 2017 
Modeling Pandemic Influenzas 
Vaccination for Adults, Maine Report. 
This estimate 
considers
 traditional administration 
avenues such as medical providers, workplace health
 programs
, school
-located vaccination 
clinics and public health sites.  It also looks a
t pharmacies and mobile Point of Dispensing 
sites.  According to this report, Maine has the capacity to administer an estimated 129,000 
doses per week (96,750 adult vaccine administrations and 32,250 pediatric vaccine 

administrations) when vaccine 
is being
 produced at 30
 million doses weekly
.  According to 

this same report, Maine will be able vaccinate 80% of Maine residents within approximately 

12 weeks, provided there is 
enough
 vaccine. 
 By utilizing the information gathered from discussions with professional organizations and the 

data 
from this report, MIP will be able to identify missed opportunities for provider enrollment 
and better target recruitment efforts.  MIP 
can also use this in
formation in
 case of an outbreak 
and 
there is a need to enroll providers in specific areas.

  Section 7: COVID
-19 Vaccine Allocation, Ordering, Distribution, and Inventory 
Management
 A. Describe your jurisdiction
™s plans for allocating
/assigning allotments of vaccine throughout 
the jurisdiction using information f
rom 
Sections
 4, 5, and 6. Include allocation methods for 
populations of focus in early and limited supply scenarios
 as well as the variables used to 
determine allocation
. The IIS and staff can designate 
providers
 as eligible 
to order COVID
-19 vaccine via the 
Pandemic Allocation functionality based on the identified priorities. The allocation tool 
allows for MIP staff to accept, deny or modify orders individually or at program level 

dependent on overall vaccine allocation amoun
ts supplied from 
the U.S.
 CDC. Providers are 

also required to update their vaccine need within the IIS which 
delineates
 the age cohorts and 
insurance status of the populations 
the organization
 serve
s to assist in assigning vaccine 
allocations.
 Maine
 will utilize the Tiberius Platforms to assist in vaccine planning, 
distribution
 and 
allocation efforts. 
This will allow us to plan provider
-level orders across a range of 
distribution scenarios. 
Tiberius provides flexible and data
-backed applications that
 enable 
users to make data
-driven decisions.
   B. Describe your jurisdiction™s plan for assessing the cold chain capability of individual 

providers and how you will incorporate the results of th
ese
 assessment
s into your plans for 
allocating/assigning allotments of COVID
-19 vaccine and 
approving 
order
s.  Providers will be required to create appropriate cold storage units (refrigerators, freezers, 

ultra
-cold) within the IIS. The creation of the units will populate the appropriate temperatures 
per unit and will require daily temperature recordings. 
Before an
 organization can place an 
order
, the 
IIS will require 
that they have the
 appropriate units for which vaccine is being 
ordered
, in-range and up
-to-date temperatures.  
MIP staff will review orders for approval by 
assessing the provider vaccine need
 and 
curr
ent inventory on 
hand. 
  C. Describe your jurisdiction™s procedures for ordering COVID
-19 vaccine,
 including 
entering/updating provider information in VTrckS and any other jurisdictional systems (e.g., 
IIS) used for provider ordering. Describe how you will incorporate 
the allocation process 

described 
in step A

  Providers mus
t enroll 
in the Maine Immunization Program in order to receive vaccine.  If a 
provider wishes to receive vaccine but are not enrolled, the provider must follow the 
following 
steps to enroll 
in the program.  
 To enroll:
  Complete and return the following forms to MIP: 
  Provider Agreement Form for 
COVID
-19  MIP Provider Agreement
  IIS
 Administrator 
User
 Agreement.
  Send pictures of the vaccine storage units to MIP enrollment staff
; participate 
in a 
virtual enrollment visit and trainings with MIP staff. 
  MIP will review all enrollment components to ensure all required components are 
complete and will notify provider if any additional information is needed or notify the 
provider that their enrollm
ent is complete
, and provider can order vaccine.
   If provider is already enrolled in MIP, provider will 
only
 need to complete the 
Provider Agreement for 
COVID
19.   To order vaccine, designated ship
-to-sites should use the defined process for ordering:
  Upda
te cold chain by entering storage unit temperatures into IIS. 
  Ensure all doses administered have been entered into 
IIS
. All 
COVID
-19 doses 
should be documented in the IIS no later than one business day after administration. 
  Reconcile inventory to ensure accurate dose count. 
  Determine the number of additional doses needed.
  Create order via IIS.  
  MIP will review and approve or deny
 orders to ensure vaccine is distributed to the 

highest need areas and /or equitably across the state. MIP staff will review current 
inventory on hand to prevent 
over
-ordering and appropriate allocations
 from the 
pandemic allocation tool
.  MIP will upload o
rder(s) from the IIS to VTrcks (ExIS) for order fulfillment.
  D. Describe how your jurisdiction will coordinate any
 unplanned
 repositioning
 (i.e., transfer)
 of 
vaccine.
  Vaccinators that are not 
ship
-to sites, community vaccinators, and/or strike teams may obtain 
vaccine from designated ship
-to sites via the pre
-existing vaccine transfer process within the 
IIS. To receive 
COVID
-19 or any other vaccines supplied by MIP;
  The organization must be an enrolled 
COVID
-19 provider. 
  Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    33 | Page
   Both enrolled sites (the transferring vaccine and the site accepting the vaccine 
transfer) must have up
-to-date temperatures in the IIS. 
  Ensure the vaccine is packaged using proper cold chain manage
ment for the physical 
transfer of the vaccine
  Include a packing list of the vaccine(s) being transported and lot information

  E. Describe 
jurisdictional 
plans for
 monitoring COVID
-19 vaccine
 wastage and 
inventory 
levels
.  The IIS Vaccine 
management
 staff 
verify 
orders based on vaccine need and current 
inventory on hand at the 
time of the 
order 
to 
reduce 
over
-ordering. 
MIP requires 
reconciliation of inventory every 14 days
 (highly recommended 
weekly)
, prior to placing 
an order, 
by performing physical counts of inventory on hand to ensure the physical 
inventory matches the IIS inventory. The IIS
 inventory will display inventory based on 
orders received and doses 
administered. 
Every dose of vaccine that is
 unaccounted for 
must be notated with a reason
 for wastage i.e
. broken vial, spoiled, drawn up but not
 administered etc. 
The MIP can review reconciliation status and 
determine wastage 

percentages on an ongoing bas
is.

 A. Describe how your
 jurisdiction
 plans to ensure 
adherence to 
COVID
-19 vaccine storage and 
handling requirements
, including cold and ultracold chain requirements,
 at all levels
:   Individual 
provider locations
 (IIS cold chain reporting)
  Satellite, temporary, or off

 (IIS cold chain reporting)
  Planned redistribution from depots to individual locations
 and from larger to smaller 
locations
 (IIS cold chain reporting)
  Unplanned r
epositioning among provider locations
  All 
COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Agreements will be reviewed for the following: 
  Signatures from both the Chief Medical Officer and Chief 
Execut
ive
 Officer 
agreeing 
to comply 
with
 agreement requirements 
Œ #7 requires organizations to comply with 
U.S.
 CDC requirements for COVID
-19 vaccine 
management
  Review of vaccine storage capacity for refrigerated, frozen, and/or ultra
-frozen 
vaccine
  Signature attesting that vaccine storage 
units listed will maintain appropriate 
temperatures as indicated in the agreement
 In addition to the agreement review and approval, all COVID
-19 vaccination program sites 
will be required to enroll in the Maine IIS, 
IIS
, and comple
te a COVID
-19 Vaccine 
Edu
cational Training. This training must be completed by the primary COVID
-19 Vaccine 
Coordinator prior to receiving COVID
-19 vaccine. This COVID
-19 Vaccine Education 
Training will either be in a manner provided by the 
U.S.
 CDC, such as 
ﬁYou Call the Shots
ﬂ, or developed by the Maine Immunization Program. This tra
ining will cover the following 
requirements, at a minimum:
   COVID

  distribution. The Maine Immunization Program will take the following steps
 to 
ensu
re these 
cold chain requirements are met
 at every level
:   Individual provider locations
 Œ current 
Maine 
VFC providers are required to record 
temperature min
imum
/max
imum
 daily
 and enter these temperatur
es at least once a 
month into the Maine IIS, with a strong recommendation that temperatures 
be entered 
weekly. The Maine Immunization Program will ensure adherence to this temperature 
reporting requirement by monitoring 
site activity compliance. 
Any site o
ut of 
compliance with temperature recording will be conta
cted immediately.
  Satellite, temporary, or off
-site setting
 Œ any providers conducting off site clinics 
must record these under the Mass Vaccination Module in 
IIS
. Additionally, providers 
must comply with recommended storage and handling procedures outlined by the 

U.S. 
CDC. Maine 
CDC 
will conduct routine spot checks for those providers 

indicating they have held 
a clinic to ensure sites are maintaining required 
clini
c temperature recording documentation and that temperatures are remaining within 

stability ranges.
  Planned redistribution from depots to individual provider locations
 Œ Maine is 
requiring that all COVID
-19 Vaccination sites com
plete both A and B sections o
f the 
COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider Agreement. All sites will be ordering and/or 
transferring vaccine under the 
ordering and transfer protocols outlined for VFC 

providers. Prior to a physical vaccine transfer taking place, both sites must have 

document
ed up-to-date cold chain 
within 24 hours and complete a transfer 
in 
IIS
. Protocols ensure that cold chain is recorded during the transfer and records remain 

with receiving site for a minimum of three years.
  Unplanned repositioning among provider locations
 Œ protocols for transferring 
COVID
-19 will be covered during the COVID
-19 Vaccine Education Training which 
includes the documentation of transfers in 
IIS
. However, if such transfers take place 
as they sometimes occur with our VFC providers, they are cau
ght a
s soon as the 
provider site tries to record administration of a vaccine that was transferred
 as that lot 
number and vaccine would not be available in their inventory
. Provider sites would 

then have to follow the transfer protocol by completing an 
electronic tra
nsfer in 
IIS
 and recording all cold chain within 24 hours of the transfer.

   B. Describe how your jurisdiction 
will assess provider/redistribution depot COVID
-19 vaccine 
storage and temperature monitoring capabilities.
 By signing the COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider Agreement the site is agreeing to continuously 
mon
itor
 vaccine temperatures. The Maine Immunization Program will ensure that the 
COVID
-19 Vaccine Education Training includes a review of acceptable vaccine storage and 
handling 
temperature monitoring devices
 and
 digital data loggers. In addition, any site that 
is 
ordering ultra
-cold vaccine will be contacted directly by the Maine Immunization Program to 
ensure that their digital data logger 
can record temperatures between 
Œ60 and 
Œ80 degrees in 
the event that vaccine is stored in an ultra
-cold unit and out of th
e vaccine packaging 
in 
which it was shipped.

communication efforts. 
This individual will build 
upon current communication
s to promote vaccine safety and dispel 
vaccine misinformation. Messaging will be tailored to reach key audiences including 
healthcare personnel, health insurance issuers and plans,
 employers, government and 

community partners and stakeholders, and public consumer and essential workers.
 B. Describe your jurisdiction™s 
expedi
ted
 procedures for risk/crisis/emergency communication, 
including 
timely 
message development as well as 
delivery 
methods
 as new information 
becomes available
. The Maine Immunization Program will develop a COVID
-19 Vaccine Distribution 
web
page 
for our website
. This will
 ensure constituents have all required and suggested res
ources in 
one location. This page will include the following:

  Vaccination Guidance During a Pandemic
 Maine CDC will also make frequent use of the statewide Health Alert Ne
twork system 
(HAN)
 to notify providers, health care systems, and other stakeholders of important 
information on a real
-time basis
. The HAN system has been in use and, during the H1N1 
vaccination efforts, was a valuable tool to apprise the public health community of importan
t 
information.  The bulletins, which can include clinical, public health, and other information, 

are publicly available on the Maine CDC website, as well: 
https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/newhan
.shtml
    Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    46 | Page
  Maine CDC also intends to engage closely with community health workers (CHW) as part of 
our educational outreach efforts.  We intend to provide information to CHWs on vaccines 

both from a safety/efficacy perspective as well as an access perspectiv
e. The goal is to equip 
CHWs with all the information they need to be effective communicators within their 

communities.  Given that many CHWs are able to communicate in the native language of 

many Maine people, the information provided to them will be avai
lable in multiple languages 
to facilitate that communication. We intend to offer specific briefings for CHWs to empower 

them to work with their communities, many of whom are immigrant and other non
-majority 
groups.
 Using risk communication 
strategies
 along with the 
U.S. 
CDC™s developed 
Vaccinate with 
Confidence
 framework
 we will 
develop 
a messaging 
campaign
 for 
Maine people. Th
e vaccination communication 
campaign will be developed 
with 
the following objectives:
   Educate the public about the 
development, authorization, distribution, and execution 
of COVID
-19 vaccines and evolving
 information
.   Ensure public confidence in the approval or authorization process, safety, and 

efficacy of COVID
-19 vaccines. 
  Help the public to understand key differe
nces in FDA emergency use authorization 
and FDA approval (i.e., licensure). 
  Engage in dialogue with internal and external partners to understand their key 

considerations and needs related to COVID
-19 vaccine program implementation. 
  Ensure active, timely,
 accessible, and effective public health and safety messaging 
along with outreach to key state/local partners and the public about COVID
-19 vaccines. 
  Provide guidance to local health departments, clinicians, and other hosts of COVID
-19 vaccination provide
r locations. 
  Track and monitor public receptiveness to COVID
-19 vaccination messaging. 
  Broad Communication Planning Phases 
 Messaging should be timely and applicable for the current phase of the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program. 
 Before vaccine is available
:  Vaccine is available in limited supply for certain populations of early focus (Phase 1) 
  Vaccine 
supply 
is increasing and available for other critical populations and the 

general public (Phase 2) 
  Vaccine is widely available (Phase 3) 
    Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    47 | Page
  Communication Activities
:  Communicate early about the safety of vaccines in general and have easily accessible, 
government information to address myths, questions, and concerns. 
  Keep the public, public health partne
rs, and healthcare providers well
-informed about 
COVID
-19 vaccine(s) development, recommendations, and public health™s efforts. 
  Engage and use a wide range of partners, collaborations, and communication and 

news media channels to achieve communication goa
ls, understanding that channel 
preferences and credible sources vary among audiences and people at higher risk for 

severe illness and critical populations, and channels vary in their capacity to achieve 

different communication objectives. 
  Communicate proa
ctively whenever possible, anticipating issues and forecasting 
possible problems before they reach broad awareness. 
  Ensure that communications meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities 

Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Patient Protection and
 Affordable Care Act, the Plain 
Language Act, and other applicable disability rights laws for accessibility. 
  Use information and education campaigns to extend reach and increase visibility of 

vaccine recommendations and resources. 
  Work closely with partn
er agencies, representatives of local communities with critical 
populations, and intermediaries to achieve consensus on actions, consistency in 

messages, and coordinated communication activities. 
  Communicate transparently about COVID
-19 vaccine risks and 
recommendations, 
immunization recommendations, public health recommendations, and prevention 

measures. 
  Messaging Considerations 
 Public health messages and products should be tailored for each audience and developed with 
consideration for health equity. It is important to use plain language that is easily understood. 

Information should be presented in culturally responsive language 
and available in languages 

that represent the communities. Jurisdictions should be careful to address all people 

inclusively, with respect, using non
-stigmatizing, bias
-free language. Insufficient 
consideration of culture in developing materials may uninte
ntionally result in 
misinformation, errors, confusion, or loss of credibility. 
  In addition, Maine CDC District Public Health Liaisons are able to use existing relationships 

with immigrant and other non
-majority populations to promote linguistically and c
ulturally 
appropriate messaging.  The District Liaisons can work with those communities to ensure 

such information is provided in an effort to promote the highest possible vaccine uptake. 
 Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    48 | Page
  Based on the feedback they receive, they can also tailor messages to
 specific groups within 
their districts to ensure that 
messaging is accurate and responsive to pressing questions.
 These considerations and any others that emerge during message development and 
deployment should be reviewed again when material is translate

 organizations should explore how specific groups are most likely to 
access information with the communication methods available to them. Feedback 
mechanisms such as a web page or e
-mail account to allow 
the audience to express concerns, 
ask questions, and request assistance are extremely important, and creating such mechanisms 

should be a priority for jurisdictions. 
 Promotion of public service announcements 
will be 
distributed 
by using and
 existing contract 
with the Maine Association of Broadcasters will be utilized for channels to broadcast with 

Radio and TV. 
Digital 
media will be displayed through the internet and social media.
 Written 
communication channels will be facilitated through Go
vDelivery and
 other 
direct chan
nels. We have al
so created an email box specific to
 receiv
e communication
s: C19Vaccine.MECDC@maine.gov

CDC 
takes steps to ensure that proactive health promotional 
communications
 are 
received by 
the intended groups and are also 
effective 
at informing those groups and/or 
correcting 
misconceptions. 
Maine CDC uses a variety of approaches:
  Engage stakeholders prior to issuing communications to ensure that their feedback is 
reflected.
  Encourage feedback from constituents after messaging has been 
issued.
  Reviewing metrics such as the number of downloads, clicks, and viewers for messages 

placed in mass media.
  At a later date, looking at health outcomes to determine whether the message had
 the 
intended e
ffect on health behavior.
  D. Describe your jurisdiction™s methods and procedures for monitoring l
ocal
-level 
situational 
awareness (i.e., strategies, activities,
 progress
, etc.)
.  Monitoring Doses Administered and Inventory on hand will help 
determine the
 
uptake 
of the vaccine and 
assist in analyzing what percentage of the population within 
each Public Health District has received a 
single dose or a completed series 
of the 
vaccine. 
PHN will 
reconcile after each clinic the number of doses given, 
as well as 
the single dose or completed series
, with the inventory
.  We will be 
requesting from COVID
-19 Vaccine Providers a
 list of open clinics and 
will be posting them on our website for 
the
 general public to has 
visibility
 on where 
they can receive a COVID

  Appendix
 A: Racial/Ethnic Minority COVID
-19 Vaccination Plan
 Maine™s approach to ensuring timely access 
to COVID
-19 vaccine for members of r
acial/ethnic 
minority group
s will
 evolve
 following consultations
 with 
members and leaders of those groups.  This 
document and plan will be updated as those discussions and consultations occur. What is presented here 
is a strategic overview of 
how the State
 of Maine intends to engage with representatives from at
-risk 
groups to ensure their needs are met from an education, outreach, access, and equity perspective.  
 ECOVID
-19 rates for racial and ethnic persons in Maine are 
disproportionately high.  Even though this 
population account
s for 
roughly
 5% of the population (see table below), this group accounts for 25% of 
COVID
-19 cases in Maine.  
   Maine is 
placing
 special emphasis 
on ensuring all Mainers, especially those 
from
 diverse racial and 
ethnic backgrounds
, have accurate information on COVID
-19 vaccine and can access that vaccine, once 
available
.  Members of the Maine 
COVID
-19 planning
 team have 
consulted
 with 
Tribal 
leaders, 
the 
Maine Migrant Health
 Program
, and the District Liaisons 
and
 we 
acknowledge
 that more needs to be 
done to reach these populations.
 Maine will work strategically with partners to meet the needs of ethnic minorities. 
Our approach will be 
to consult regularly with representatives of 
racial
/ethnic minority communities to understand their 
needs, first and foremost, and build systems responsive to those needs in partnership with such groups.
 
Much of this consultation and planning will occur via 
a working group specifically designed to address
, understand, and plan 
for the needs of these populations across Maine.
  Maine Covid
-19 Vaccination Plan
    55 | Page
  There are a variety of considerations this working group will 
discuss. In advance of the arrival of a 
COVID
-19 vaccine, the group can help design, draft, and distribute educational mat
erials on the 
importance and safety of vaccination generally, as well as the benefits of establishing a relationship 

with a health care provider.  As 
a vaccine 
is slated for arrival in Maine, 
this working group can help 

understand and plan for the optimum 
way to encourage uptake of the vaccine at the community level.  

Specifically, the working group can address issues related to access to the vaccine, taking into account 

factors like transportation, geography, 
open hours of service
.  The working group can a
lso provide 
guidance to Maine CDC on culturally appropriate 
means of communication around vaccine safety and 
efficacy.
  Collaborations with partners that are already engaged with these populations will help reach these 
groups 
in an effective manner
 (e.g., the Department of Health and Human Services™ Health Equity 
Improvement Initiative)
.  Maine will work with these partners to developed culturally appropriate 
messaging and outreach methods to serve these populations. 
Maine
 DHHS has been hosting mont
hly 
webinars for the provider community to address 
racial and ethnic disparities related to COVID
-19 and 
will focus its 
November webinar on strategies to reduce vaccine hesitancy in 
communities
 of color.
 As 
well as working with current partners, the respon
se team will the Public Health District Liaisons to 
identify other organizations that already providing outreach to racial and ethnic minorities.
 Potential partners include
, but not be limited to
:  Community Organizations led by 
and/or 
that serve 
minority populations
  Local offices of Minority Health and other public health organizations employing CHWs
  Other states: utilize resource developed by other states for racial and ethnic populations 
  Churches and Religious organizations with racial and ethn
ic membership
  Tribal leaders and Health Centers
  Translation service providers
 The working group
 will
 ensure minority groups are able access and seek out COVID
-19 outreach 
services. 
It will monitor COVID
-19 response activities to underserved populations such as ethnic and 
racial minorities, people experiencing homelessness, LBGTQ
+, or other groups identif
ied as potentially 
vulnerable.  
Tactically, t
he 
working group
 will utilize IIS data as well as applications such as Tiberius 
to monitor COVID
-19 vaccination efforts
 and uptake
. The 
working group
 will use 
these
 data to develop 
or modify their plan of action for outreach to special populations.  
The 
working group
 will also 
coordinate with Strike Teams and local healthcare facilities to connect minority groups with 

vaccination 
services

  Appendix E
:  Draft Prioritization Framework for Consideration
 Pasted below is the framework developed by the 
National Academy of Science, Engineering, and 
Medicine for prioritization of COVID
-19 vaccines.  This draft framework is currently under discussion 
in Maine
. As with much of COVID
-19 vaccine planning, this framework could change based on the 
efficacy and o
rder in which different candidat
e vaccines are approved.  
If so, this draft framework 
could be changed to reflect which vaccines are available at the time.

      7 Section 1: 
COVID
-9 Vaccination 
Preparedness Planning
 Planning and Preparedness Activities 
 Early in the 
COVID
-19 
pandemic, 
the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (
MDPH
) recognized 
the need to prepar
e a statewide vaccine strategy to ensure capacity 
and
 mount a campaign 
once
 a vaccine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and doses become available. 
 As part of this early planning, MDPH 
reviewed
 the lessons learned and improvement planning from the 
2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign. 
 At the conclusion of tha
t pandemic, MDPH 
 held a
n 
after
-action
 conference and 
developed 
a formal After Action Report/Improvement Plan (AAR/IP)
, 
with areas of 
improvement highlighted for particular offices and bureaus.  
 In the summer of 2019, MDPH participated in the federal leve
l pandemic planning 
exercise Crimson 
Contagion. 
 Massachusetts was the lead state for 
the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services
 (HHS) Office of the
 Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) Region 
I.  Given that the 
scenario of the ex
ercise was built around a
n influenza
 pandemic
, the AAR/IP from Crimson Contagion 
was reviewed to further guide the planning for the upcoming COVID
-19 vaccination campaign.   
 Several items highlighted between the two AAR/IP documents are currently being us
ed to strengthen 
planning efforts.  Th
ese include:
  Considering ways to expand the pool of individuals who can provide vaccinations
 Š this include
s commercial vaccinators
  Reviewing internal processes to streamline or adjust guidance to allow for changes to 
be 
communicated to 
health care providers
 in a timely manner 
  Review
ing
 both existing and new platforms/sources of data to support identification of 
population groups by traditional demographic data points
, as well as by geography
 Exercises and Continuous Improvement Activities 
 The MDPH Office of Preparedness and Emergency M
anagement (OPEM) will coordinate ongoing 
assessment and maintenance of the Massachusetts COVID
-19 Vaccination 
Plan through a series of 
discussion
-based exercises
.  All MDPH exercises will be planned and evaluated following Homeland 
Security Exercise and Ev
aluation Program (HSEEP) guidelines
.  We will develop a
n AAR/IP and 
disseminate
 it following each exercise, and 
track 
completion of corrective actions by the OPEM Planning 
and Exercise Unit
 to support continuous improvement activities. 
 To 
assess 
what comp
onents of 
the 
plan 
need to be operationalized and 
to 
align appropriate resources,
 MDPH will work with exercise and training staff and vendors to develop a Table
top
 Exercise (
TTX)
 for 
each 
of the three
 phases of vaccine availability, as well as the vaccine
-based scenarios, as described in 
the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (
CDC
) Interim Playbook
.  Each TTX will include the 
appointment of a planning team that has representation from multiple 
agencies and 
sectors, including 
those who serve/support individuals within the identified 
critical
 populations
 to support the design, 
development, 
conduct, evaluation
, and improvement planning
 of each exercise
. The first exercise will 
occur in 
Calendar
 Year
 (CY) 2020 fourth
 quarter (Q
4) and subsequent exercises will occur in 
CY 2021 
Q1 and Q
2. As appropriate, plan updates will be made to address identified corrective actions.

Authorities
 Massachusetts is one of six New England states. 
 Although 
geographically 
small (45th in area among the 
50 states), 2010 Census data ranks the Commonwealth 14th in population (6,547,629), and fifth in terms 
of population density. 
 There are 49 cities and 302 towns in the Commonwealth. 
 More than half of the 
state
™s residents liv
e in the area bounded on the west by Interstate Highway 495, and on the east by the 
Atlantic Ocean. 
 Federal Regional Coordination
 As part of the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency 

(FEMA) and 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Region I (along with Maine, New 

Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Connecticut), Massachusetts participates in s
tanding weekly 
calls hosted by 
FEMA and 
the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response 
(ASPR) to 
discuss response coordination with public health and emergency management agencies 
across 
the six New England states. 
 Massachusetts 
participates 
in the planning and 
contributes to the 
development of the COVID
-19 Regional Federal Support Plan for vaccination planning within Region 
I.  Massachusetts Local and Regional Coordination
 Massachusetts has a decentralized public health system, wi
th each of its 351 cities and towns having its 
own governing body and health board with 
authority to provide 
public health services to its residents. 
This has resulted in 
a significant 
range of capacity 
with respect to staffing at the local level
. MDPH
™s Office of Local and Regional Health 
(OLRH
) provides leadership in collaboration with internal 
and external public health stakeholders to strengthen the capacity of Massachusetts local boards of 
health to protect the health of their communities and t
o deliver essential public health services. 
 OLRH 
strengthens partnerships with municipalities through the Massachusetts Large Cities Project and 
Massachusetts Rural Local Public Health Project. 
 OLRH coordinates its efforts with external stakeholder 
inclu
ding the Coalition for Local Public Health, Local Public Health Institute, Western Massachusetts 
Public Health Association, and the Massachusetts Public Health Regionalization Working Group.
 OLRH has been instrumental in coordinating with local boards of h
ealth throughout the COVID
-19 response and will leverage existing communications and outreach mechanisms in support of the MCVP.   

These existing mechanisms include:

 Health and Medical Coordinating Coalitions
 There are currently six regional Health and Medical Coordinating Coaliti
ons (HMCCs) in Massachusetts 
that
 conduct capabilities
-based, cross
-disciplinary planning and support 
for 
public health and 
provide 
medical response during emergencies and disasters. Core disciplines are acute care hospitals, 

community health centers, emer
gency management, emergency medical services, long
-term care, and 
local public health.
 HMCCs support integrated planning and capacity
-building across the six core disciplines. 
 As part of the 
prior cooperative agreement, each HMCC developed an Emergency Co
ordination Plan and annex to 
support resource sharing and coordination. 
 During an emergency, each will work within their regions to 
coordinate information gathering, situational awareness, and resource requests. 
 HMCCs 
have
 the 
capacity to stand
-up a mult
i-agency coordination center to support regional response and recovery 
activities
, and can be leveraged to support vaccine planning and coordination among their stakeholders
.  HMCCs work closely with other health and medical partners and build strong conne
ctions with 
emergency management and public safety/first responder organizations within the region, as well as 

other public and private organizations with a role under Emergency Support Function 8 (ESF8), public 
health and medical services. 
 HMCCs particip
ate in mitigation activities as identified through planning 
and response activities and in cooperative training, including National Incident Management System 
(NIMS) and Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program
-compliant exercising of regional pla
ns. 
 Public Health Preparedness Planning Coalitions 
 Within each HMCC are public health preparedness planning coalitions, 
accounting for a total of 
15. 
 Each 
coalition is funded with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health 
Emergency 

Preparedness (CDC PHEP) funds to build jurisdictional
-level capacity to prepare for, respond to, 
and 
recover from public health emergencies
, and mitigate the impacts
.  Included in their scope is the 
development and testing of Emergency Dispensing
 Sites (EDS). 
 There are more than 500 primary and 
secondary sites identified in Massachusetts.

COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      16 Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID
-19 Vaccination
 The Massachusetts 
COVID
-19 Vaccination Plan
 is aligned with the three phases of vaccine availability, as 
well as the vaccine
-based scena
rios, as described in the 
U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) 
COVID
-19 Vaccination Program
 Interim Playbook
 for 
Jurisdiction Operations 
Version 1.0
, dated 
September 16, 2020 (Interim Playbook)
.  The goal is to maximize vaccine acceptance and public health 
protection, while minimizing waste and inefficiency. 
 The Massachusetts COVID
-19 Vaccination Program 
(MCVP) will monitor vaccine inventory, distribution, and any repositioning of the vaccine to e
nsure end
-to-end visibility of vaccine doses throughout all phases of the MCVP.
  As outlined in Section 5, the MPDH 
Immunization Division will be engaging in active recruitment and enrollment of all immunizing provider 
sites to fully support all three phas
es of the COVID
-19 vaccination effort outlined below.
 Phase 1: Potentially Limited Supply of COVID
-19 Vaccine Doses Available
 Based on the scenarios provided
 by the CDC
 in the Interim Playbook
, Massachusetts can expect initial 
allocations of between 20,000 and 
60,000 doses of COVID
-19 vaccine.
 Based on this scenario, MDPH 
anticipates prioritizing the following populations: 
  Healthcare personnel (HCP) likely to be exposed to or treat people
, wit
h COVID
-19  People at increased risk for severe illness from COVID
-19, including those with underlying 
medical conditions and people 65 years of age and older
  Other essential workers
 CDC guidance
 as outlined in the 
CDC 
Interim Playbook
 further refines the t
arget groups for when vaccine 
is very limited as follows: 
  Phase 1a:
  Paid and unpaid person
s serving in health care settings who have the potential for 
direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials and are unable to work from home
  Phase 
1b:  
Other essential workers and people at risk for severe COVID
-19 illness, including 
people 65 years of age and older
 Because the first doses of the vaccine are likely to be targeted to HCP in contact with COVID
-19 patients, 
MDPH is prioritizing hospitals, 
long term care facilities, including 
skilled nursing facilities (SNF), 

emergency medical services (EMS), and other 
he
alth care 
providers 
for recruitment and enrollment in 
the 
MCVP
.  MDPH is 
coordinating
 with 
commercial vaccinators 
to 
register
 them in the Massachusetts 
Immunization Information System (MIIS)
, if they are receiving COVID
-19 vaccine through federal 
agencies
.  Commercial vaccinators
 may assist hospitals and other entities to maximize throughput at 
vaccination clinics, while maintaining infection control procedures.
 Initial allocations of the vaccine will depend on the following factors:
  The provider™s ability 
to reach the populations targete
d  The provider™s ability and readiness to manage cold chain requirements, 
and 
to 
meet reporting 
requirements for vaccine 
administration

 characteristics, including the age group for which 
each 
vaccine 
is 
recommended by the ACIP
  MDPH 
knows
 that this initial allocation of vaccine will be insufficient to immunize all providers 
associated with health care institutions and long
-term 
care facilities.  Within each participating facility
 prioritized by MDPH
, prior identification of clinical providers and non
-clinical staff with anticipated direct 
contact with COVID
-19 patients, patients over 65, and those with specific co
-morbid conditio
ns will be 
identified 
and flagged for prioritized vaccin
e allocation
.  Strict allocation management by facility and 
specificity of eligible recipients at the facility level will be 
required 
to ensure complete and equitable 
distribution of vaccine in this i
nitial phase.    
 Hospitals and large medical centers providing care to COVID
-19 patients have existing emergency 
preparedness plans that include strategies for the rapid and structured delivery of needed 
immunizations to direct
-case clinical and non
-clinical staff.  
It wil
l be expected that facilities will utilize 
their EP systems to allocate vaccine according to the protocols as outlined. 
 Given the constrained clinical and administrative capacity of some 
skilled nursing facilities (SNFs)
 and 
the successful deployment of S
ARS
-CoV
-2 testing to skilled nursing, assisted living, other LTCFs
 and 
congregate care settings
, M
assachusetts
 intends to seek deployment 
 the M
assachusetts
 National Guard 
to provide supplementary support for immunization of their staff and residents and for reporting of 

immunizations to the MIIS.  
 Phase 2: Large Number of Vaccine Doses Available
 In Phase 2, MDPH ensur
e continued access to vaccine for the po
pulations listed above in Phase 1 and 
begin to provide vaccine for the 
broader 
population.  To prepare for this phase, MDPH is broadening its 
vaccine provider network. In addition to the 
local health departments
, hospitals, 
community 
health 
centers (CH
Cs
), and pediatric providers who are the mainstay of the 
current 
Vaccine Program, MDPH is 
reaching out to 
a broader range of health care 
 providers in the state who currently are not reporting 
immunization data to the MIIS 
and asking them to 
regis
ter with the 
MIIS. 
The MDPH Immunization 
Division will send an email to all licensed physicians
 and advanced practice nurses
 in the state 
specializing in internal medicine, family medicine, obstetrics, and gynecology
, via the
 Health and 
Homeland Alert Network (HHAN)
.  These physicians will receive information on how to enroll in the 
MCVP.  See 
Section 5: COVID
-19 Vaccination Provider Recruitment and Enrollmen
t. This broad network of vaccine providers will enable the timely distribution of doses 
in anticipation of 
a surg
e in demand for the vaccine.  MDPH will continually monitor vaccine usage and adjust 
allocation 
strategies to minimize vaccine wastage 
in the event 
demand for the vaccine
 in certain areas is 
lower 
than expected.
 During this phase of allocation MDPH will be
 highly reliant on the capacity of its community
-based 
health system, in particular its over 
52 community health centers (CHC
s, comprised of 
Federally 
Qualified Health Centers 
[FQHCs
] and look
-alike members of the Mass League of Community Health 
Centers)
, in over 280 sites which have deep, prior relationships with 
communities of color and 
African 
American, Latinx, Asian/Pacific Islander, LGBT, and non
-US born communities, considerable cultural and 
linguistic capacity, 
a substantial community health worker s
taff complement, and 
health care 
accessibility at the local level.  
    MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      18 Supplementary, targeted immunization access will also involve the extensive network of commercial and 
clinic
-based pharmacies.
  Ongoi
ng coordination with pharmacies continues; their 
registered pharmacists 
and supervised pharmacy interns are authorized under M
assachusetts
 regulation and policy to 
administer the full range of vaccines for individuals age 
3 and older.  
 Depending on the vo
lume of vaccine over the course of this phase and on the analysis of immunization 
capacity and population need outlined in Sections 4 and 
6 of this Plan, activation of locally organized 
Emergency Dispensing Sites 
(EDS) 
may be necessary to ensure timely loc
al immunization access in some 
geographic areas, particularly those with limited hospital/health center capacity.
 Close and ongoing analysis of vaccine allocation and administration in clinical facilities and pharmacies 

throughout this phase will be needed
 to ensure equitable access by geography and affected community
, and the nimble ability to adjust allocations to prevent and address immunization inequity.
 Phase 3: Sufficient Supply of Vaccine Doses for the Entire Population (Surplus of Doses)
 When there 
is an adequate supply of COVID
-19 vaccine for everyone, the MCVP will focus on ensuring 
equitable vaccination across the entire population.   The MCVP will continuously monitor vaccine uptake 

and coverage to identify underserved areas or populations in the
 state.  
 When areas of low vaccine uptake are identified, the MCVP will more aggressively recruit and enroll 

providers in those areas and/or direct vaccinators to those communities.  MDPH will partner and 
collaborate with local communities to identify
 inf
ormational, attitudinal, and resource 
obstacles and 
barriers to COVID
-19 vaccination and develop culturally appropriate strategies to address them
, 
including the engagement of trusted community leaders and influencers within identified communities
. Through
out all phases of the MCVP, MDPH will continue to broaden its provider network to expand 
access to the vaccine and, where necessary, partner with vaccinators to fill 
identified 
gaps.  Training of 
COVID
-19 vaccine providers will continue throughout the prog
ram (See 
Section 5: Provider Recruitment 
and Enrollment
). During this phase of vaccine access, the full complement of hospital, 
CHCs
, pharmacies, 
EDS
, and locally  
organized immunization clinic capacity  will be needed to manage the volume of vaccine admin
istration 
and meet community demand.  Careful planning for ancillary supplies, appointment management, social 
distancing strategies/masking sufficiency, MIIS data entry,  and post
-vaccination patient observation will 
need to be performed, with MDPH guidanc
e, at each point of vaccine access.  
 Clear and reinforced communication will be needed to reach all residents of Massachusetts about the 
broad, free availability of vaccine, vaccine safety and efficacy, the mechanisms for accessing vaccine, 
and the urgenc
y to seek timely immunization through this network of trusted immunization sites.  
Targeted communications to individuals and communities anticipated and observed to be more hesitant 

to COVID
-19 immunization will need to come from local providers and organ
izations, including the 
growing corps of culturally competent community health workers, to address concerns and 
misinformation and support making appointments and making plans for safe travel to local 
immunization sites.
 During this phase, paramedics worki
ng with local Emergency Medical Services providers, who have been 
active in delivering SARS
-CoV
-2 testing statewide with the practical support of Emergency Medical 
Technicians, will be useful adjuncts to Phase 3 immunization plans, as they can be deploy
ed  responsively to observed gaps in immunization coverage, set up neighborhood
-level access points, and 
   MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      19 support clinical and non
-clinical institutions facing greater
-than
-anticipate demand.  Locally organized 
Mobile Integrated Health 
(MIH) 
programs can be th
e organizing framework for these providers, directed 
by city/town governments, and coordinated with local health department immunization plans.
 In order to ensure that the cost of administering COVID
-19 vaccine is not a barrier to providers enrolling 
in th
e program, the federal Health Services and Resources Agency (HRSA) announced that pursuant to 
the CARES 
Act, it will reimburse providers for the cost of administering COVID
-19 vaccine to people who 
are uninsured and Medicare Part D will reimburse for 
administering the vaccine to those who carry Part 
D. MDPH is starting to work with MassHealth, the state Medicaid program, and private insurers to 
secure their participation in the program.
 Equitable Access to COVID
-19 Vaccine
 MDPH is committed to ensuring that everyone in the Commonwealth has access to COVID
-19 vaccination services and information.  To optimize equitable access to the vaccine for all critical 
populations and achieve high vaccination coverage in these groups, as
 well as in the general public, 
MDPH, especially the Offices of Local and Regional Health (OLRH), Community Health Planning and 
Engagement,
 Office of Health Equity
 (OHE)
, and 
Rural Health
, 
and external partners
 will work with local 
communities to 
address 
cultural and linguistic barriers and other impediments to vaccination. 
See 
Section 12: Vaccination Program Communication.
 As 
part of enrollment in the MCVP, providers 
will 
 agree to not deny vaccine to 
any patient
 because of 
inability to pay.  In addition, during training and through other communications with providers, they will 

be 
firmly 
instructed to not
 inquire
 about immigration status for anyone seeking the vaccine.

      20 Section 4: Critical Populations
 The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (
MDPH
) Infectious Disease Emergency Response Plan 
(IDER
) v2.0 February 2020,
 includes general estimations for Seasona
l Influenza Vaccine priority groups 
through extrapolation of national estimates as listed in the 2018 Interim Updated Planning Guidance on 
Allocation and Targeting Pandemic Influenza Vaccine. 
 Using this data along with Centers for Disease 
Control and Prev
ention (
CDC
) COVID
-19 guidance in the Interim Playbook on the 
three phases of vaccine 
availability
, MDPH will identify and prioritize critical populations within the Commonwealth consistent 
with 
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NA
SEM)
 recommendations the final 
prioritization of the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
(ACIP
).  In addition,
 MDPH will refer 
to emerging evidence of historic and COVID
-19-specific vaccine hesitancy and under
-immunization risk. 
Particular concern
s surround the African American and other 
Black communities who have expressed 
concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, linguistic minorities who may have lesser access to current 

and reliable information about the vaccine, and some non
-US born resident
s who may have concerns 
related to governmental engagement related to immigration status.
  Once critical populations are identified, MDPH will identify 
parameters and data sets needed to inform 
the prioritization model for the distribution of the vaccine b
y phase (
and 
subsets 
of populations 
within 
in each phase), 
and by 
priority group and location
.  This will be
 followed by completing the model, 
projections
, and requisite mapping.  This planning 
will be 
completed with a social equity lens to ensure 
the critical populations reflect the most vulnerable. 
 These have included enumerating populations in 
need of testing.  
MDPH will engage the services of a vendor to provide analytical capacity and 
will be 
charg
ed with utilizing U
.S. Census (and reliable intercensal estimates of populations conducted by the 
University of Massachusetts Donahue

outreach (utilizing community health worker
 outreach
, mobile integrated health services, and 
community health center events to impro
ve uptake).
 MDPH will make every effort to ensure estimates are as
 accurate as possible to minimize potential 
waste of vaccine, constituent products, or ancillary supplies. As appropriate
, MDPH will engage the 
help/support of partner 
agencies

ions to provide access to key data packets as well as 
to 
verify the modeling outcomes.
 MDPH will

associations (e.g. Mass Health and Hospital Association) and professional organizations representing 
care for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions (e.g. 
Massachusetts Senior Care 
Association
; the Dis

 to 
establish points of contact (POCs) and communication methods for organizations, employers, or 
communities
 (as appropriate) within the 
identified 
critical population groups where those relationships 
do not currently exist.
  Supplementing these will be the robust 
MDPH 
direct
-to-provider 
communications enabled by MIIS enrollment.  Critical targeted 
midstream messaging to vaccinators 
ordering and being allocated vaccine through the MIIS can target providers in areas of inadequate 
coverage and highlight the need to engage members of critical populations where additional outreach is 
needed.

 vaccine distribution system 
and/or reporting data to the Massachusetts
 Immunization Informat
ion System (MIIS
).  This includes all 
pediatric provider sites, major hospital systems, community health centers, local health departments, 

and 
approximately
 1,000 pharmacy locations.  
 MDPH is 
actively 
connecting with partners and stakeholders to identify
 provider sites that are not 
registered with the MIIS
, but
 will be administering vaccine to critical populations as defined by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (
CDC
).  These include 
but are not limited to 
Internal 
Medicine practices, 
obstetri
cian
-gynecologist
 practices, Long Term Care Facilities
 (LTCF)
, Assisted Living 
Residences, and Rest Homes. 
 Particular focus includes reaching out to providers who serve 
 communities of color and historically marginalized groups including 
the African Ameri
can and other 

Black communities, 
Latinx, Asian/Pacific Islander, LGBT, and non
-US born communities
 to ensure access 
to the vaccine in their community. 
 MDPH is actively 
conducting 
outreach to identified 
provider 
sites
 (as listed above)
 informing them that 
they must register for the MIIS and begin the onboarding process to report their immunization data. 
Active recruitment of these additional health care providers is ongoing, and a streamlined enrollment, 

registration, and onboarding pro
cess is 
in process 
in partnership with the Virtual Gateway (MDPH™s 
hosting agency) and 
MDPH™s 
application vendor Strategic Solutions Group
 (SSG)
.  Provider sites registering with the MIIS submit their National Provider Identifier (NPI) for site validation 

purposes. 
 Sites 
that
 enroll with the MDPH Immunization Division State Vaccine Program undergo a 
thorough enrollment process. 
 The Vaccine Unit confirms that providers have current licenses on file and 
validates these through
 the Office of Inspector Genera
l to ensure providers do not have any exclusions 
on record. 
 As a part of the COVID
-19 vaccine enrollment process, which is being integrated into the
 existing
 MIIS
 enrollment process
, providers who may administer COVID
-19 vaccine
 in Massachusetts
 will 
prov
ide their medical license numbers. 
 The Vaccine Unit will check those licenses to ensure that 
providers are eligible to practice within the state. 
 Every provider that enrolls with the MCVP will need to have a 
Chief Medical Officer/Chief Executive 
Officer
 (CMO/CEO
), or equivalent
, sign 
CDC™s
 COVID Vaccine Provider Agreement.  In addition, sites 
must identify
 a primary and 
back
-up COVID
-19 vaccine coordinator
 who
 must ensure that staff onsite

    MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      25 States are not required to provide training for federal entities and commercial partners receiving direct 
COVID
-19 vaccine allocations from CDC. MDPH will coordinate with CDC to identify those entities 
receiving direct allocations 
from CDC
 and ensure they are still registered and reporting their data to 
MIIS
. Approval of Planned Redistribution of COVID
-19 Vaccine
 MDPH will leverage a tool in the MIIS 
Vaccine Management 
module which tracks transfers. Providers 
may redistribute vaccin
e only 
if they have a Redistribution Provider Agreement signed and on record in 
the MIIS. Providers will be able to redistribute to sites that have a signed COVID
-19 Provider agreement 
form. All transfers will be monitored by 
the 
Vaccine Unit
.   Coordinati
on of Equitable Access to COVID
-19 Vaccination Services
 MDPH is reaching out to adult providers who are historically under
-registered for the MIIS to provide 
the information and resources necessary to register for and report data to the MIIS. To further ex
pand 
equitable access of COVID
-19 vaccination, MDPH purchased 
the 
PrepMod
 System
, a
n application
 that 
local health departments
, and other entities without an 
Electronic Health Record 
(EHR) system
, may use 
for patient management, billing, recording, and rep
orting of immunization events to the MIIS. MDPH 
continu
es to leverage community partnerships 
in order 
to recruit additional COVID
-19 vaccination 
providers 
and
 expand equitable access to COVID
-19 vaccination when vaccine supply increases.  MPDH 
will 
map
 all registered providers and their patient capacities and comparing with local census numbers 
to ensure all areas of the Commonwealth are adequately covered.
 See Section 4
: Critical Populations.
 Recruitment and Enrollment of Pharmacies not Served 
Directly by CDC
 There are approximately 1,000 pharmacy locations registered and reporting immunization data to the 

MIIS
, including all major commercial pharmacy chains.  MDPH will outreach to 
independent and chain 
commercial 
pharmacies requesting that they
 take an inventory of all their  Massachusetts
 locations
, to 
ensure that all are registered with the MIIS and actively reporting data. In that communication, MDPH 
will provide instructions 
for
 identified pharmacies 
to register for the MIIS and begin the on
boarding 
process to report their immunization data. MDPH acknowledges that some multi
-jurisdictional 
vaccination providers will enroll directly with CDC
, in order to receive COVID
-19 vaccine 
Œ and CDC will 
notify 
MDPH 
of any entities receiving direct alloc
ations within their areas. All enrollment for COVID
-19 
vaccine will be electronic and occur through the MIIS
, and even large national pharmacy providers who 
receive vaccine directly from CDC will be required by law to report vaccine administ
ered
 in 
Massach
usetts
 to the MIIS.
       MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      26 Section 6: COVID
-19 Vaccine Administration Capacity
 In order to 
estimate COVID
-19 vaccination capacity in Massachusetts, it is useful to start with historical 
provider capacity during annual influenza seasons and during the 2009 H1N1
 influenza pandemic.   
 In Phase 1b (as identified in Section 3), health care personnel (HCP) will be the first targeted population 
for COVID
-19 vaccination.  
As a condition of licensure, 
the Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
(MDPH)
 regulations req
uire health care facilities, including hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, 
dialysis centers, clinics, nursing homes, rest homes, and adult day health programs to:
 Ł Document receipt
s of influenza vaccine administered in 
or
 outside the facility
, or document the 
declination of immunization for HCP
 Ł Report information to MDPH documenting compliance with the vaccination requirement, in 
accordance with reporting and data collection guidelines of the Commissioner (105 CMR 
130.325,
 105 CMR 140.150, 105 CMR 150.002(D)(8), 105 CMR 158.030(L)(8))  
 For the 2018
-2019 influenza season, acute care hospitals reported that 94% of health care personnel 
(HCP) had received influenza vaccine.  HCP flu vaccination rates were 72% for skilled nurs
ing facilities 
and 83% for dialysis centers.  Where necessary, hospitals and other health care facilities can work with 
commercial vaccinators to enhance their capacity to provide COVID
-19 vaccine to their employees.
 MDPH is reviewing its list of providers currently enrolled in the MDPH Vaccine Program, and identifying 

gaps in enrollment, particularly for adult providers and commercial vaccinators.  MDPH will determine 

each
 provider™s capacity to meet the storage and h
andling requirements described in the scenarios 
for 
Vaccines A and B. MDPH will assess a provider™s capacity and plans to receive and administer vaccine 

quickly.  
 MDPH is engaging
 the  
additional data analytics capacity of 
a contractor
 to assess and map vaccinator 
capacity, drawing from public datasets, provider surveys
, and professional organization data (e.g.
, Mass 
Medical Society, associations of chain and independent pharmacies), 
Massachusetts Immunization 
Information System (MIIS)
 enr
ollment data, and MDPH clinical and professional licensure data to 
characterize the distribution, accessibility, staff capacity, and maximum throughput of each major 

category of providers of immunizations.  These analytics will be used to prioritize recrui
tment of new 

providers into the MIIS and the deployment of targeted response teams (Massachusetts National Guard, 

mobile integrated health teams, community health centers) to areas of inadequate vaccine availability 

or provider capacity.
 MDPH will monitor 
provider vaccine usage data to identify areas of the state that need additional 
providers and will focus provider recruitment on those areas and/or direct commercial vaccinators. 
 MDPH will use data regarding the number and types of providers to focus prov
ider recruitment efforts.

COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      27 Section 7: COVID
-19 Vaccine Allocation, Ordering, Distribution, and 
Inventory Management
 COVID
-19 Vaccine 
Allocation
 The 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (
MDPH
) Vaccine Unit
 is responsible for vaccine 
allocation.  Vaccine allocation will be based on priority groups
, as identified by 
the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (
CDC
) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
 (ACIP
), and approved by 
the 
Commissioner of Public Health 
, by the number
, profile,
 and types of providers registered with the 
Massachusetts Immunization Information System (MIIS)
, and by the estimated patient volume of the 
provider practices. 
 Early dose distribu
tion will be limited; therefore, phased allocation of early vaccine doses will likely be 
necessary. Populations of focus for initial COVID
-19 vaccine doses are expected to include healthcare 
workers (including ancillary staff, vaccinators, and staff in 
Lon
g-Term Care Facilities
), other essential 
workers, and people at higher risk for severe COVID
-19 illness.
 The
 MDPH Vaccine Manager is the
 Designated Distribution Manager
. The following guidelines will 
support the allocation of COVID
-19 vaccine in Massachuse
tts:
  All providers must be registered with the MIIS
 in order to receive vaccine.  Registration of 
providers is currently on
-going
, and a streamlined process will be implemented to rapidly 
register any remaining providers as needed
.  MDPH will be notified of
 current allocation daily through CDC™s daily allocation report. 
The 
report will include number of doses and formulations available for Massachusetts
.  Based on number of doses and formulations available, MDPH will allocate doses directly to 
provider sites 
based on priority groups for vaccination and the quantities available at the time.
 Allocations will be made as frequently as 
additional supply is
 made available
.  Prior to being approved to receive vaccine, providers will have to 
attest that they have the
 appropriate storage units and processes available to manage the vaccine cold chain
.  Storage units for vaccine will need to be continuously monitored by Digital Dat
a Logger
 (DDL)
 (also known as Continuous Temperature Monitoring Systems) and a report should be available 
to be uploaded into the MIIS to ensure that the cold chain has not been broken
. COVID
-19 Vaccine Ordering
 The 
MDPH Vaccine Unit
 is responsible for man
aging and approving orders from enrolled providers. 
 During Phase 1 when vaccine is limited:
  Vaccine Unit
 will create the vaccine allocations
 using the allocation and prioritization principles 
outlined by both the ACIP and MDPH Leadership Group. These allocations will be made
 in an 
Excel spreadsheet or other electronic format and then upload
ed into the MIIS, also known as a 
bulk upload. This me
thod is used for flu vaccine during regular flu season.
  Sites that receive allocations will have a current COVID
-19 Provider 
Agreement, appropriate 
storage units, and records showing that the cold chain can be maintained
.    MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      28  MIIS
 Unit
 will generate a vaccine order file that the 
MDPH 
Vaccine Unit
 will upload into CDC™s 
Vaccine Tracking System 
(VTrckS
) tool. This will then generate the vaccine order information 
that is transmitted to the distributor McKesson and/or 
the 
manufacturer.
 This
 is the same 
system currently used by MDPH for the management of close to 3.2 million doses annually.
  An email will be sent to every provider receiving an allocation informing them of the number of 
doses and formulations in their allocation
 and the necessa
ry storage and handling requirements 
for that vaccine
. During Phase 2 and beyond
, as 
vaccine supply increases
:  Providers will be able to order vaccine directly through the MIIS Vaccine Module
, but all orders 
will continue to be reviewed and approved by the
 MDPH Vaccine Unit
, ensuring equitably 
vaccine distribution.
  Vaccine Unit
 will approve orders based on vaccine usage and documentation of temperatures
.  Once the orders have been approved, an order file will be generated in the MIIS that will be 

uploaded in
to the CDC VTrckS tool. This will generate order information that is transmitted to 
the distributor McKesson and/or manufacturer
.  Assumption 
Š Once vaccine orders have shipped from McKesson, 
the current centralized 
distribution vendor, 
the vaccine order confirmation information, also known as a shipment file, 
will be downloaded from VTrckS into the MIIS, where the shipment tracking information is made 

visible to the provider site. The shipment
 file will ensure that provider™s virtual inventory is 
updated and maintained in the MIIS
. COVID
-19 Vaccine Distribution
 COVID
-19 vaccine will be distributed by
 McKesson
 for federally contracted vaccines directly to each 
provider site enrolled in the MIIS 
that is being allocated vaccine by the MDPH
 Immunization Division
. There is a possible second vaccine that will be distributed to large providers directly from the 

manufacturer.
  At this time vaccine distributed directly from the manufacturer is to be kept
 at ultra
-cold 
temperatures (
-60°C to 
-80°C). 
 The
 Vaccine Unit
 will generate provider enrollment data twice a week that will be uploaded into the 
SAMS system using a template that has been created by CDC. 
 This will continuously update CDC 
systems and McK
esson distribution on the correct shipping address, provider contact information, and 
shipping hours.
 Vaccine will be distributed in minimum quantities of 100 doses
 and ultra
-cold formulations will be 
distributed in 1,000 dose quantities
. Once an order is 
submitted to CDC, the order should be fulfilled 
within 48 hours. On
ce vaccine has shipped from McKesson, the vaccine order information should be 
included in a downloadable report called the Shipment File. The Vaccine Unit will upload the shipment 
file dail
y to ensure that providers maintain an accurate inventory.
 The shipment file should include 
tracking information so that providers know when to expect vaccine.
 COVID
-19 Vaccine Inventory Management
 COVID
-19 vaccination providers will be required to report inventory of COVID
-19 vaccines. 
The
 Vaccine 
Unit
 will be able to generate an inventory file for providers that can be uploaded directly in VTrckS.
    MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      29 Inventory can be updated in two ways
:  Providers who are 
enrolled to receive
 COVID
-19 vaccine are required to register to report data 
to the MIIS. As sites are reporting data, their 
virtual 
inventory should automatically decrement. 
  If vaccine is not decrementing, sites will be required to submit a 
reconciliation via the MIIS 
Vaccine
 Management 
module.
 COVID
-19 Vaccine Redistribution and Transfer
 Redistribution may be allowed if a site is unable to use the number of doses 
it was allocated.
 Redistribution will be tracked through transfers completed in
 the MIIS Vaccine
 Management m
odule.
  Prior to planned redistribution, p
rovide
rs sending/transporting will do the following:
  Contact the Vaccine Unit to receive 
approval 
of the
 redistribution 
  Sign the 
supplemental redistribution agreement form
  Have

  Maintain the same storage and handling requirements as sites that receive vaccine directly from 
CDC distribution vendor
  Upload current temperature log
s  Accept the inventory
 Prior to planned redistributio
n, the 
Vaccine Unit will
 do the following
:  Confirm the provider site receiving vaccine has 
signed the COVID

 COVID
-19 Vaccine Expiration and Wastage
 Information about handling expiration dates will be included in training documents. 
  Current information from CDC states that vaccine vials and cartons will not include a printed 
expiration dates. Instead
, expiration dates will be updated based on stabilit
y data. Providers 
must go to the U
.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) website to determine the 
expiration dates for specific lots. 
  CDC is developing beyond use date (BUD) tracking 
labels
 to assist with tracking expiration dates 
at the point 
of vaccine administration
.    MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      30  The inventory in the MIIS Vaccine
 Management
 module can be edited. 
It is
 possible that 
expiration dates can be added to the module
.  Training will be necessary to ensure that staff are aware of BUD and are not confusing the 
manufa
ctured date with the expiration date
. At this time there is not guidance about how COVID
-19 vaccine should be returned. Under the 
assumption that COVID
-19 vaccine will be returned similar to 
the process for 
routine vaccines, the 
following will occur:
  As in
ventory expires or is wasted due to temperature excursions, sites can process a Storage and 
Handling incident in the Vaccine
 Management
 Module. This incident will track the issue and 
remove vaccine from the virtual inventory. The 
Vaccine Unit
 staff will ha
ve to approve each 
incident and will use these incidents to recommend further training. Once approved, expired 

and wasted vaccine for all sites will be exported into a CSV file that can be updated into VTrckS. 
In turn this data will be sent to McKesson to 
produce a return label for the provider to ship 
vaccine to McKesson. 
            MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
PLAN
      31 Section 8: COVID
-19 Vaccine Storage and Handling
 COVID
-19 vaccine products are temperature
-sensitive
, and must be stored and handled correctly to 
ensure efficacy and maximize shelf life. 
 Proper storage and handling practices are critical to minimize 
vaccine loss and limit risk of administering COVID
-19 vaccine with reduced effectiveness. Maintaining 
the 
vaccine cold chain will be dependent on proper staff training, reliable storage units and temperature 
monitoring equipment, and inventory management. 
 Individual Provider Locations
 The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (
MDPH
) will require storage a
nd handling training for 
primary and 
back
-up COVID
-19 vaccine coordinators. 
 The 
Chief Medical Officer/Chief Executive Officer
 (CMO/CEO
) signatory 
and 
primary and 
back
-up COVID
-19 vaccine coordinators must ensure that staff 
onsite know correct procedures f
or maintaining vaccine cold chain. 
Primary and 
back
-up COVID
-19 vaccine coordinator
s are primarily responsible for ensuring correct COVID
-19 vaccine management.
 MDPH will recommend that provider sites have written 
Standard 
Operating 
Procedures (SOP
s) and will 
provide template SOPs that can be adapted for each practice location
.  Accurate and up to date SOPs 
will help facilitate training other staff and ensure proper vaccine management. 
 MDPH
 is planning with the assumption that 
provider sites 
are requ
ired to use purpose
-built/pharmaceutical
-grade units for refrigerators.
  Provider sites receiving vaccine must have storage units that can store the vacci
ne being 
received
. The type and capacity of refrigerator, freezer, and ultra
-cold storage will be track
ed in 
the enrollment record.
  Storage and handling temperature requirements for COVID
-19 vaccine will vary. 
 o Refrigerated: 2
°C to 8°C
 o Frozen: 
-15°C to 
-25°C
 o Ultra
-cold:  
-60°C to 
-80°C
 o Ongoing stability testing may impact requirements (this information is b
ased on COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations).
  Vaccines that require ultra
-cold storage can be stored in their shipping containers with dry ice. 
Prior to approving orders for vaccine with ultra
-cold storage 
requirements, MDPH will ensure 
that there is a documented ultra
-cold freezer or 
there is
 access to a dry ice vendor.
 The MDPH Vaccine Unit is currently surveying providers enrolled in the Vaccine Program to evaluate 
ultra
-cold storage capacity at pediatric
 provider sites, hospitals, 
community 
health 
centers (CHCs), and 
multi
-specialty provider practices.  The results of this survey will inform existing capacity and the need 
for enhancing ultra
-cold 
storage capacity statewide.  In addition, an ultra
-cold sto
rage unit is being 
purchased by the Vaccine Unit for maintenance of doses
, if needed at MDPH.  The Vaccine Unit has also 
reached out to a refrigeration vendor that could be contracted it needed for large capacity ultra
-cold 
storage.
    MASSACHUSETTS 
COVID

 MDPH will provide 
DDLs
 to monitor temperatures
, and 
providers are required to upload DDL reports monthly or with every order.
 Accurate 
vaccine

management
 is critical. 
MDPH will send an email of the order confirmation
s so that provider sites can prepare to receive vaccine. 
The 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC
) centralized distributor
, McKesson
, will delive
r vaccine directly to the provider site
; for ultra

, the vaccines will be shipped directly from the manufacturer
. Upon arrival, 
vaccine shipping 
information will be received from 
Vaccine Tracking System 
(VTrckS
), and uploaded into the 
Massachu
setts Immunization Information System 
(MIIS
), which will automatically add those vaccine 
doses into the provider site™s virtual inventory in the MIIS.  At that point, 
primary and 
back
-up vaccine 
coordinators are responsible for the vaccine cold chain
 up until the point of vaccine administration
.  Vac
cine vials and cartons will not contain a printed expiration date. 
 Instead, expiration dates will be 
updated based on vaccine stability studies. 
 Current expiration dates by vaccine lots for COVID
-19 
vaccine will be posted on a U
.S. Department of Health a
nd Human Services website. 
Providers will be 
required to check the website for expiration dates. 
 CDC will develop label templates to track beyond 
use dates that will be provided to provider sites.
 As of now, CDC has not provided guidance for vaccine dispo
sal. Providers can report vaccine expired or 
wasted through the MIIS. 
 Once submitted, MDPH will approve the storage and handling incident
, and 
create 
an export for upload into VTrckS.
 If there are any storage and handling incidents, vaccine must be 
marked as ﬁ
Do not useﬂ and 
quarantined to prevent accidental administration. 
 The vaccine manufacturer will determine viability.
 Satellite, Temporary
, or 
Off

Settings
 Satellite, temporary, or off
-site settings can assist in providing equitable access 
for COVID
-19 vaccination.
  MDPH will work with providers 
that are 
planning 
to host 
clinics to ensure that the quantity 
of vaccine received is based on population anticipated to be vaccinated.  Provider sites that utilize 
satellite, temporary, or off
-site s
ettings must understand and use appropriate transport and storage 
protocol. 
 Sites conducting clinics at satellite, temporary, or off
-site 
settings 
must contact the 
Vaccine 
Unit
 to ensure the transport protocol 
is followed
, and 
to receive
 additional DDLs
 if needed
.  Storage 
units for C
OVID
-19 vaccine products must be monitored continuously. 
 Providers will be required to 
upload a DDL report into MIIS after every clinic. 
 At the end of clinic, vaccine must be moved back to a 
fixed storage unit with temperatu
re monitoring. 
 Planned Redistribution
 See Section 7: COVID
-19 Vaccine Allocation, Ordering, Distribution, and Inventory Management
 Unplanned repositioning
 Provider sites that are eligible for redistribution will have signed the redistribution agreement, been 

appropriately trained, and will be required to have an SOP. 
 If there is an unplanned move, provider sites 
receiving the vaccine should not administer v
accine until they have 
received 
approval from MDPH.
  Provider sites repositioning vaccine should contact 
the
 Vaccine Unit 
as soon as possible. 
 The

 Process to Ensure Vaccination Providers can Report Required Data every 24 Hours
 Approximately 90% of
 providers in 
the MIIS
 send their immunization 
data
 via 
Health Level Seven
 (HL7)
 electronic messagin
g 
through their 
Electronic 
Health 
Records (
EHR)
 system
; this data typically is sent 
automatically in real time or within a few hours. 
 Additional communication 
by the MIIS Unit 
will be sent 
to all providers regarding th
e requirement
 to 
report data to 
the MIIS
. The MIIS 
Unit 
has increased staff capacity to ensure adequate technical support for existing providers
™ reporting and for onboarding new providers onto the MIIS
.  An additional trainer has been hired to 
assist with training ini
tiatives
.  See Section 5: COVID

reporting. 
 Rollout and training for 
the 
Prep
Mod 
System 
is currently underway.   
 We will run q
ueries to identify and reach 
out 
to providers who do not report within the 24

PLAN
      36 Current Capacity for Data Exchange, Storage, and Reporting & Planning Improvements
 As of September
, 2020, there 
were 
close to 3
,000 
provider sites sending or entering data to the MIIS
, and 996 q
uery data from the MIIS. 
 There are 7,987,480 unique patients and 67,559,134 
vaccinations
 in 
the MIIS. 
 Historically, 
the 
MDPH
 MIIS system 
ha
s seen peaks in 
unsolicited vaccination record update (
VXU
) messages at around 7,000 messages per hour and
 MDPH
 test
s to about 11,000 VXU messages per hour 
in performance tests. 
 For 
query by parameter (
QBP
), 
the 
historical peak is about 12,500 messages per 
hour, and 
MDPH 
test
s to about 18,000 QBP messages per hou
r in performance tests. 
 MDPH 
estimate
s that 
it is at about 65% of tested capacity. 
 Outside of
 flu season 
MDPH 
see
s approximately 2,000 VXU 
per hour, at 
which 
time 
MDPH is
 at 20% of 
its
 VXU capacity. 
 QBP has not proven to be very seasonal
, apart from loc
k-down for C
OVID
-19.
  In summary, the MIIS has sufficient storage/capacity to support an 
increase in XVU and QBP and segment pattern response due to COVID
-19 administration events.  
 Rapid Enrollment and Onboarding to MIIS
 MIIS team is in discussions and r
eviewing plans for rapid enrollment and onboarding. 
 We have taken 
initial steps for enrollment that include implementing electronic signature collection for Virtual Gateway 
forms in lieu of paper forms/wet signatures. 
 This is expected to be completed by the end of October
, 2020. Modifications to response times for enroll
ment approvals and creation have also been negotiated 
with the Virtual Gateway.  Expedition for any account requests for the MIIS will be approved and 
created in a 24
-48-hour window
, which is reduced from the normal 7
-day timeframe. 
 Some early 
considerations for expediting onboarding include:
 Bypassing Certification testing and sending all sites directly to production. 
 Data Quality would be 
conducted in production and if issues are found
, sites w
ould
 be asked to fix and re
-send data. This could
 speed up 
an onboarding project
 by 
weeks o
r months. 
 Sites would be set up immediately to begin entering data directly through the MIIS user interface 
(website). 
 At the same time, technical onboarding could proceed through the normal process
, and once 
com
plete
, the technical feed could be turned on
, and direct data entry 
would cease. 
 Potential risk: 
depending on the volume of administration events this could prove to be significantly labor intensive for 
the organization.
 Status and Plans to Onboard to the
 IZ Gateway Connect and Share Components
 The ability to 
connect and 
share is 
under programmatic and legal review.  MDPH is concurrently testing 
its connectivity capability with the IZ Gateway.
 Backup Solutions for Offline Use
 The MIIS is in discussions reg
arding off
-line reporting. 
 One initial consideration to support providers
, if 
internet connectivity is lost or not possible
, is to allow
 providers to complete a roster excel template of 
patient vaccination events. 
 This template can be distributed via ema
il prior to any foreseen outages. 
The template can also be accessed through the MIIS.  Once internet issues have been resolved the 

provider may upload the template through the MIIS Roster Entry function. 
 If internet outage is not

and 
targeted 
messaging to specific
 audiences
, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) has identified 
the following 
goal and priorities for the Massachusetts COVID

:  Statewide Communications Goal:
  Provide clear, 
accurate, 
consistent, and timely information a
bout the Massachusetts COVID
-19 
Vaccination Program
 with an emphasis on building vaccine confidence broadly among groups 
anticipated to receive early vaccination and 
to 
dispel vaccine misinformation to ensure vaccine 
uptake.
 Statewide Risk Communications P
riorities: 
  Ensure coordination with appropriate partners to inform 
accurate
 and timely messaging around 
the safety of a COVID
-19 vaccination to the general public as well as 
to 
various stakeholder 
groups
.  Ensure coordination with appropriate partners to i

Program
.  See Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID
-19 Vaccination.
  Ensure that information about the COVID
-19 vaccine is
 accessible and culturally and linguistically 
appropriate for reaching key audiences. 
  Consult with the MDPH Office of Health Equity and other established partner networks to be 
sure messages are effective and useful
. MCVP Communications Plan: Three Key 
Components
 Through the Communications Group, MDPH is engaged in developing a detailed communications plan 
Œ
incorporating the audiences, the messages, the channels, and the time/phases. 
 MDPH
 will leverage the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention™s (
CDC™s
) recently developed 
Vaccinate with Confidence 
framework
 to support the development of MCVP messaging. 
 Statewide public awareness campaign developed wi
th an external vendor
.  MDPH follows a data
-driven process for developing messaging and creative assets for paid 
media/awareness campaigns and messaging to specific audiences will be based on data 
collected from health communications research
  For example, M
DPH
, with its Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Science (BIDLS)
, conducted a Flu Vaccination research study in July
, 2020
, to better understand Massachusetts 
residents™ attitudes toward receiving flu vaccinations. 
 The outcomes of this study are 
captured 
in the Flu Vaccination Report and could assist MDPH in messaging for the COVID

  MDPH
 procedures for risk/crisis/emergency communication align with known Crisis and Emergency Risk 
Communication (CERC) principles. 
  Be First
  Be Right
  Be Credible
  Express Empathy
  Show Respect
 Timely public information during an emergency can calm people™s fears
, manage their expectations, and 
help persuade them to make important health
-related decisions to assist in ensuring their safety.
  MDPH 
has existing plans in place that clearly define the risk/crisis/emergency communications

communicate with partners 
Š to include the Health and Homeland Alert Network
 (HHAN), WebEOC, 
and 
a number of audience
-specific 
Listservs. 
 If the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) is act
ivated, the Massachusetts Emergency 
Management Agency (MEMA) may establish a Joint Information Center (JIC) to coordinate messaging 

across multiple state agencies, and the MDPH Public Information Officer (PIO) would participate in the 
JIC.
 MDPH 
will use he
alth literacy standards to create materials intended for the general public
, including
, but not limited to

information.  MDPH is committed to reducing health disparities by setting standards for materials 
development that require the use of plain language, relevant visuals, and effec
tive layout and design to 
ensure information is accessible to the target audience, especially those with limited language 
proficiency.  
 Depending on the scope of the emergency and populations affected, MDPH will typically
  produce
 public

      46 scorecard indicates if the information in the application meets or does not meet expectations. 
 These 
scorecards are updated monthly and found on the provider™s landing page on the MIIS website.
 Vaccine ordering and distribution
 MDPH will use the MIIS to m
onitor and process COVID
-19 vaccine ordering.
  During Phase 1, MDPH will 
upload a spreadsheet of all orders into the MIIS.  Once vaccine supply has increased
, providers will enter 
orders directly into the MIIS. 
 The
 Vaccine Unit
 will review and approve ord
ers to ensure doses ordered 
are administered. 
 The Vaccine Unit
 will use the temperature logs submitted by providers to ensure that 
storage units are maintaining the appropriate temperature range. 
 Once approved, the MIIS will produce 
an export for upload 
into 
the 
Vaccine Tracking System 
(VTrckS
).  MDPH will require providers to contact 
the Vaccine Unit
 prior to transfer of vaccine to another site. 
 MDPH will transfer inventory in MIIS so 
that virtual inventories reflect physical inventories. 
 Prior to approving transfers, 
the Vaccine Unit
 will 
ensure that the site receiving vaccine has signed all required agreements and ha
s the appropriate 
storage un
its. 
 The 
Vaccine Unit
 will approve all COVID
-19 transfer of vaccines and ensure that the site 
has completed all required paperwork to received and administer vaccines.
  1- and 2
-dose COVID
-19 vaccination coverage 
 Determining vaccination coverage without
 a wide
-scale survey is a challenge because of the difficulty in 
determining the appropriate denominator. 
 The 
U.S. Census
 and the American Community Survey will be 
used to establish denominators for age groups and geographic areas. 
 The numerator will con
sist of the 
number of doses administered to each group, as reported by providers.
 Methods and Procedures for Monitoring Resources
 MDPH will utilize the 
following 
budget, staffing, and suppl
y tracking 
mechanisms to monitor resources:
  Budget: Regular 
monitoring includes a monthly meeting with programmatic and fiscal staff to 
review all budgets
  Staffing: Program managers continuously monitor staffing need
s and s
taffing updates are 
provided during
 regular senior managers' meetings, and
, on an ad hoc basi
s, as necessary
  Supplies: Inventory lists are used to track supplies so that re
-ordering can happen when certain 
supply levels decrease below specified thresholds
 Methods and Procedures for Monitoring Communication
 MDPH will continue to 
participate in CDC all
-jurisdiction calls and monitor regular email communication 
and website updates to ensure Massachusetts™ messaging is consistent with CDC national messaging.
 MDPH will monitor social media to assess message delivery and reception, and
 to identify and dispel 
inaccurate information.  
See Section 12:
 COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Communications.
   Methods and Procedures for Monitoring Local
-level Situational Awareness
 Frequent situational reports from local public health officials and comm
unity partners will allow MDPH 
and its partners to quickly identify gaps in planning and implementation at the local level and provide 

technical assistance as necessary. 
 MDPH will monitor the CDC COVID
-19 Vaccination Response 
Dashboard as data become avai
lable.
 See Section 2: 
COVID
-19 Organizational Structure and Partner 
Involvement.

 Purpose
 This document provi
des Intermediate Care Facilities for People with an Intellectual Disability or 
Related 
Conditions (ICFs) with guidance in the event of a positive COVID
-19 case associated 
with the facility.
  Additionally, included in this document is information regarding 
emergency 
rules, visitation and mitigation expectations.
 Individual
s of ICFs are more susceptible to COVID
-19 infection and the detrimental impact of the 
virus than the general population. In addition to the susceptibility of 
individual
s, an ICF 
environmen
t presents challenges to infection control and the ability to contain an outbreak, 
partly due to 
individual
s living in close proximity to others, which could result in potentially rapid 
spread among a highly vulnerable population.

 Ł Review the
 CDC™s LTC Webinar Series
, including:
 o Clean
 Hands
; o Closely Monitor
 Individual
s; o Keep COVID

 Out
; o PPE Lessons
; and
 o Sparkling
 Surfaces
 Ł Utilize the ASPR TRACIE 
workforce virtual toolkit
. Ł Comply with all CMS and CDC guidance related to infection control. ICFs need to 
frequently monitor CDC and CMS guidance as it is being updated often. This will ensure 
the ICF
 is operating off the most current guidance.
 Ł For the duration of the state of emergency, all 
ICF personnel should
 wear a facemask 
while in the facility. Staff who are have been appropriately trained and fit
-tested can use 
N95 respirators. 
Staff who are car
ing for 
individual
s with COVID
-19 or 
caring for 
individual
s in a building with widespread COVID
-19 infection, should wear an N95 
respirator and all suggested PPE. See guidance in the section related to
 PPE use when 
caring for 
individual
s with
 COVID
-19
. Ł If N95 or other respirators are used, review
 OSHA™s Respiratory
 Protection Training 
Videos
. Ł Actively screen everyone who comes into
 the 
facility.
 Ł To avoid transmission within facilities, ICFs to the best of their ability should use separate 
staffing teams for COVID
-19
-positive 
individual
s and designate separate ICFs or units 
within an ICF to separate COVID
-19
-negative 
individual
s from COVI
D-19
-positive 
individual
s and people with unknown COVID
-19 status.
 Ł Quarantine
 individual
s as per CDC guidance.
  Ł Isolate
 individual
s with positive
 cases
. Ł Clean and 
disinfect
 the facility 
if 
there is 
a positive case.
 Ł Coordinate 
individual
 diagnoses and symptoms with transferring
 and receiving hospitals 
and other
 ICFs. Ł Communicate with 
individual
s, staff, and family when 
there is 
exposure
 to or 
suspected or 
confirmed c
ases in the
 facility.
 Ł Keep an up
-to-date list of all staff who work in other facilities. The list does not have to 
include the names or locations of the other facilities, just whether the staff member works 
at other facilities.
 Ł Minimize the movement of sta
ff between facilities as much as possible.
 Ł Require staff self
-monitoring on days they work. Ask staff to self
-monitor on days they 
don™t work.
 Ł Require
 staff
 to report
 via
 phone
 prior
 to reporting
 for
 work
 if
 they
 have known exposure or
 symptoms.
 Ł Follow the guidance beginning on page 
38 of 
this document to
 determine when staff can 
return to work after recovering from an
 illness.
   January 
18, 2022
 Page

  Ł Post a list of state contacts where it is visible on all shifts. The list
 should at least include 
phone numbers for the
 local health authority
 or DSHS
 office 
and the
 regional HHSC LTCR 
office
. Ł Follow physician™s plan for immediate care of any 
individual
 with a
 positive case. Orders 
can include increased assessment frequency, increased monitoring of fluid intake and 
output, supportive care, a treatment
 plan,
 and what to do in case of a change in 
the 
individual
™s status.
 Ł Inform the 
individual
 of treatment or supportive 
health
care plans; 
individual
s have the 
right to participate in 
their own 
care.
 Ł Upon the first positive test result of an ICF staff member or 
individual
, consider testing of 
all ICF s
taff and 
individual
s. Ł If needed, request deployment of the TCAT
-ICF team.

 S.P.I.C.E.
 Recognizing 
a potential COVID
-19 
situation 
in a facility can result in disorientation, questions, 
and confusion; this document suggests 
ICF
s focus on the following five ba
sic actions (S.P.I.C.E.) 
to anchor activities:
  Surveillance 
Œ Monitor for symptoms 
Œ fever, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty 
breathing 
Œ for each 
individual
 at 
least once 
a day.  Protection/PPE 
Œ Protect workforce and 
individual
s through soap/water
 and hand sanitizer
 per CDC guidance
. If coughing or potential splash precautions are needed, 
wear a gown and face/eye shields. Refer to DSHS guidance
. Keep a 
two-week
 supply 
of PPE on han
d as

 ICFs and COVID
-19
 ICF/IIDs
 provide 
residential
 and habilitation services to people with intellectual disabilities or a 
related condition.
 Environment
 A small ICF home
 is often integrated into the community and is typical of other residences in the 
community. These residential settings include a mix of semi
-private and private individual 
bedrooms; many of the bedrooms are shared, accommodatin
g two to three people. The bedrooms 
usually do not have physical barriers like walls or partitions separating the space allotted for each 
individual
 inside the room. 
 Rules
 require a
 minimum
 of 80 square
 feet
 for
 a private
 (one
 person)
 bedroom,
 60 square f
eet per 
person in multiple occupant rooms, and a minimum dimension of 8 feet for a private room and 10 
feet for a shared room. The common areas in an ICF are intended for use by the 
individual
s of the 
facility. These areas include dining and living room sp
aces, activity areas, and common bathing 
units, which are provided at a ratio of one tub or shower for every 8
 individual
s. A large ICF
 might be made up several cottages similar to a small ICF home, a larger building more 
similar in design to a nursing facility, or both. A large ICF is also typically a mix of semi
-private 
and private 
individual
 bedrooms; many
 of the bedrooms are semi
-private, accommodating two to 
three people. The bedrooms usually do not have physical barriers like walls or partitions separating 
the space allotted for each 
individual
 inside the room. 
 Rules require a minimum of 80 square feet 
for a private (one person) bedroom, 60 square feet 

per person in multiple occupant rooms, and a minimum dimension of 8 feet. Many of the common 
areas in a large ICF are intended for use by groups of people. These areas include dining and living 
room spaces
, activity and therapy areas, and common bathing units, which are provided at a ratio 
of one tub or shower for every 15 
individual
s. Impact of environment on COVID
-19 response:
 The relatively small size of a typical ICF residence makes it challenging for p
roviders to effectively 
support 
physical
 distancing 
measures or accommodate 
quarantine or isolation
 measures. A single 
shared kitchen can pose infection control challenges when both 
individual
s and staff access the 
kitchen throughout the day.
 While adhering to the core principles of COVID
-19 infection 
prevention
 and following CDC 
guidance
, communal acti
vities and dining can occur. Additionally, group activities can 
be 
facilitated for 
individuals
 who have fully recovered from COVID
-19, as well as for those not 
in isolation for observation or with suspected or confirmed COVID
-19 status
.  Facilities can 
off
er a variety of activities while also taking necessary precautions. For example, book 
clubs, crafts, movies, exercise, and bingo are all activities that can be facilitated with 
  January 
18, 2022
 Page

  21
  alterations to adhere to the guidelines for preventing transmission. Group acti
vities 
for 
individuals 
that adhere to the following criteria are acceptable:
 Ł Limit the number of people in an area of the facility participating in an
 activity 
to a number that will ensure 
physical 
distance is maintained 
when not all 
participants are vaccinated
. Ł Individuals 
who are fully vaccinated may have close contact and do not have 
to physically distance according to CDC guidance. 
 Ł Staff and 
individuals
 perform appropriate hand hygiene before and after each 
activity.
 Ł Clean and san
itize the activity area and all items used before and after each 
activity.
 Facilities should consider additional limitations based on status of COVID
-19 
infections in the facility.
 Facility Demographics
 ICFs are located in metropolitan, urban, and rural lo
cales. Each locale has specific characteristics 
that impact workforce availability, health care system support, and interactions with public 
health, emergency care, and jurisdictional administration. Texas currently has 786 community 
ICFs and 13 State Supp
orted Living Centers (SSLCs).
 Impact of facility demographics on COVID
-19 response:
 ICFs in more densely populated locations are likely to experience higher risk for exposure among 

staff and visitors. As a result, facilities in metropolitan and urban areas
 have a higher risk of 
infection and face more challenges controlling spread when infection occurs. ICFs in more rural 

locations have less health care system support, might not have local health authorities, and 
have smaller staffing pools, making it harde
r to cover shortages that result from suspected 
exposure. Facilities in both metropolitan and rural areas are likely to face staffing shortages 
because of competitive job markets and have challenges finding PPE.
 Facility Considerations
 Facilities have 
small
 or 
large
 bed capacity and differ in age, size, available space, and 
equipment. Available services also differ
 by facility,
 affecting
 the level
 of available
 care;
 ventilator
 support
 might not be
 present, and the types of health care providers available 
or on
-site will also
 vary.
 Impact of facility considerations on COVID
-19 response:
 Most ICFs have limited or no isolation rooms available. Most small ICFs are not equipped to care 

for 
individual
 with fragile medical conditions. Bed capacity along with staff and PPE availability 
also affects the number of 
individual
s for which each facility can provide care. COVID
-19 positive 
  January 
18, 2022
 Page 
22
 of 
  22
  individual
s will increase the staff and resources required to provide care 
further limiting the 
number of 
individual
s for which a facility can care.
 Individual
 Demographics
 All
 ICF
 individual
s must
 have an intellectual disability (IDD) or related condition
. While
 all
 have an IDD 
or related condition, each 
individual
 is unique and might require
 habilitation services, minimal 
supportive care, or significant medical care. 
Individuals™ 
conditions
 will
 vary
 physically
 and mentally,
 impacting
 mobility
 and intellectual capaci
ty.
 Impact of
 individual
 demographics on COVID
-19 response:
 In addition to having an IDD or related condition, many ICF 
individual
s need care from medical 
professionals who are in increasingly short supply as the pandemic continues. Also, the population 
of individual
s with IDD and related conditions are often unable to express
 when
 they
 experience
 symptoms
 and could
 unknowingly
 (and
 without staff knowing) spread the virus if infected. This 
population is also less likely to 
understand why 
physical 
distancing 
and quarantine are necessary 
and can present
 challenging
 behaviors
 when
 staff
 attempt
 to enforce
 such
 restrictions. Having 
COVID
-19 infections in a facility will increase the demands on and for
 staff.
 ICF Staffing Considerations
 The ICF workforce includes qualified intellectual disability professionals (QIDPs), house managers, 

medical professionals, and direct care staff including: 
registered nurses (RNs), licensed vocational 
nurses (LVNs), facility support staff and other skilled and non
-skilled workers. Rules require ICFs 
to provide
 nursing
 services
 as needed, and most small ICFs use contract medical providers rather 
than staff pro
viders to do so.
 Impact of ICF staffing considerations on COVID
-19 response:
 Many ICF 
individual
™s daily activities, such as dining, bathing, grooming, and ambulating, require 
partial or total assistance from facility staff. Caring for someone with COVID
-19 requires additional 
time and resources, including PPE, to maintain infection control and protect other 
individual
s and 
staff. As staff are exposed, become symptomatic, or test positive for COVID
-19, the available 
workforce will decline, making it even mo
re challenging for ICFs to provide care. 
 Additionally, ICFs don™t normally have a physician on
-site. Typically, direct care staff are in the 
facility and health care professionals are available by phone. Staffing shortages
 resulting
 from
 possible
 exposure
 could
 lead
 to ICFs
 refusing
 to admit 
individual
s because they won™t have the 
ability to provide care. It is also common for ICF staff to work in more than one ICF, so if an 
employee is exposed, it is likely they will expose 
individual
s and staff i
n more than one ICF, 
making it difficult to contain spread.

  Impact of 
Visitors
 During routine ICF operations, visitors including family members, volunteers, consultants,
 external
 providers,
 and contractors
 routinely
 enter
 facilities.
 Many
 perform essential
 services necessary for 
facility function.
 Impact of 
visitors 
on COVID
-19 response:
 Despite efforts to screen visitors prior to allowing them to enter the facility, every person 
allowed inside the building increases the risk of infection. Some people
 will
 present
 as asymptomatic
 during
 screening
 but will
 have
 COVID
-19 and unknowingly spread the virus. Some 
visitors will not follow standard precautions
 including
 proper
 hand
-washing,
 use
 of hand
 sanitizer,
 use
 of PPE, isolation protocols, and limiting the number of areas in the building that they access, 
all of which increase the risk of infection for 
individual
s and
 staff.

  ATTACHMENT 
2: Interim Guidance for 
Prevention, 
Management, and Reporting of COVID
-19 Outbreaks in 
Long
- Term Care Facilities
  Purpose
 This document provides guidance to ICFs for the prevention, management, and reporting of 
COVID
-19 outbreaks. Prompt recognition and immediate 
isolation of suspected cases is critical to 
prevent outbreaks in residential facilities.
 Background
 Because of their congregate nature and 
individual
s served (adults with IDD or a related 
condition, often with underlying medical conditions), ICF population
s are one of the most at risk 
of serious illness caused by COVID
-19. Every effort must be made to prevent the introduction 
and spread of disease within these facilities. 
 People at high risk for developing severe COVID
-19 include those who are 65 or older,
 immunocompromised (including cancer treatment), or have other high
-risk conditions such as 
chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, and heart conditions. People of any age with 
severe obesity or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly 
if not well
-controlled, such 
as diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease, might also be at risk.
 COVID
-19 is most likely 
to be introduced into a facility by ill DSP or visitors. ICFs should 
implement visitor restrictions
, as per CDC guidance and HHSC rule
, and strictly enforce sick 
leave policies for ill DSP. 
 Immediate Prevention Measures
 Supplies for Recommended Infection Prevention and Control Practices
 Ł Hand hygiene supplies:
 o Put alcohol
-based hand sanitizer with 60
Œ95 percent alcohol in every 
individua
l room (ideally inside and outside of the room) and other 
individual
 care and 
common areas (outsi
de dining room, in living room); and
 o Make sure sinks are well
-stocked with soap and paper towels for handwashing.
 Ł Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette:
 o Make
 tissues and facemasks available for people who are coughing
; and o Consider designating staff to steward those supplies and encourage appropriate use 
by 
individual
s, essential visitors, and staff
. Ł Make necessary PPE available in areas where 
individual
 care 
is provided. Put a trash can 
near the exit inside the 
individual
 room to make it easy for staff to discard PPE prior to 
  January 
18, 2022
 Page 
27
 of 
  27
  exiting the room or before providing care for another 
individual
 in the same room. 
Facilities should have supplies of:
 o Facemasks
; o N95 re
spirators (if available and the facility has a respiratory protection program 
with trained,
 medically cleared, and fit
-tested
 DS
P); o Gowns
; o Gloves
; and
 o Eye protection (face shield or
 goggles)
. Ł See guidance in the section related to
 PPE use when caring for 
individual
s with
 COVID
-19
. Ł Consider implementing a respiratory protection program compliant with the OSHA 
respiratory protection standard for employees if
 not already in plac
e. The program should 
include medical evaluations, training and fit
 testing
. Ł Ensure e
nvironmental cleaning and
 disinfection
. Ł Make sure EPA
-registered, hospital
-grade disinfectants
 are available to allow for frequent 
cleaning and disinfection of high
-touch surfaces and shared 
individual
 care
 equipment
: o Refer to 
List N
 on the EPA website for EPA
-registered disinfectants that have 
qualified under EPA™s emerging
 viral pathogens program for use against
 COVID
-19
; o Clean and disinfect
 all high
-touch surfaces frequently includ
ing
 items like 
doorknobs,
 light switches, handrails, countertops, remote controls, bathroom 
surfaces/fixtures
; o Workstations include items like computers, chairs, keypads, common
-use items 
(pens, pads, phones) 
- clean and disinfect
 frequently
; and
 o Equipment includes items like bloo
d pressure cuffs, hoyer lifts, adaptive equipment, 
wheelchairs and other shared equipment used for 
individual
 care 
- clean and
 disinfect after each
 use.
 Screening and Education

   has a confirmed diagnosis of
 COVID
-19;
  is under investigation for COVID
-19;
 or  is ill with a respiratory
 illness.
 3. Testing positive
 for COVID
-19 in the last 10 days.
 Active screening 
Œ HHSC 
COVID
-19 rules
 require an ICF
 to screen all staff prior to entering the 
facility at the beginning of their shift 
in accordance with HHSC guidance.
 Actively 
take their 
temperature and document absence of or shortness of breath, new 
or worsening
 in cough, and 
sore throat. If they are ill, 
immediately send them 
home to self
-isolate. For the SSLCs, HHSC 
recognizes that documenting the absence of symptoms on all staff daily might pose a challenge 
and will educate surveyors accordingly.
 DSHS has created a 
screening lo
g template
 for facility. Facilities should also screen any essential 
visitors who are permitted to enter the building, including health care providers. Maintain a log 
of all visitors who enter the building that at minimum includes name
 and current contact 
information and 
documents the 
results of the screening
. A provider must screen individuals according 
to 
HHSC guidance:
  upon admission or readmission
, and
  at least once a day. 
 Education 
Œ Share the latest information about COVID
-19 and review CDC guidance
. Educate 
individual
s and families about COVID
-19, actions the facility is
 taking to protect them and their 
loved ones (including visitor restrictions) and actions 
individual
s and families can take to protect 
themselves in the facility. Educate and 
train DSP and reinforce sick leave policies and adherence 
to infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene and selection and use of 

PPE. Have DSPs demonstrate competency with putting on and removing PPE. Remind DSPs not 
to report to wor
k when
 ill.
 Educate consultant personnel (therapists of different disciplines, behavior support specialists, 
etc.). Including consultants is important because they often provide care in multiple facilities and 
can be exposed to, or serve as, a source of pa
thogen transmission.
 Non-essential personnel 
Œ Review and revise how the facility interacts with vendors and 
delivery personnel, agency staff, EMS personnel and equipment, transportation providers (when 
taking 
individual
s to offsite appointments, etc.), an
d other non
-health care providers (food 
delivery, etc.). This should include taking necessary actions to prevent any potential 

transmission. For example, do not have supply vendors bring supplies inside the facility. Instead, 

have vendors drop off supplies
 at a dedicated location, such as 
a front or back patio
. Essential services such as 
therapists of different disciplines, behavior support staff, or direct 

support professionals 
should still be permitted to enter the facility provided they are wearing all 
appropriate PP
E, per 
CDC guidance
, and undergo the same fever and symptom screening 
process as facility staff. Facilities can allow entry of these essential 
staff only
 after s
creening.

  HHSC s
urveyors should not be restricted.
 HHSC surveyors are conducting surveys and 
investigations remotely, by regional offsite review, or through the use of telecommunications to 
the extent practicable, as well as limiting surveys and investigat
ions to essential activities only. 

CMS and state survey agencies are constantly evaluating their surveyors to ensure they don™t 
pose a transmission risk when entering a facility. For example, surveyors might have been in a 
facility with COVID
-19 cases in t
he previous 14 days, but because they were wearing PPE 
effectively per CDC guidelines, they pose a low risk to transmission in the next facility and must 

be allowed to enter. However, there are circumstances under which surveyors should still not 
enter, su
ch as if they have a fever or any additional signs or symptoms of illness.

 Control Measures
 Control Measures for 
Individual
s Most of the actions to prevent or control COVID
-19 outbreaks in ICFs are not new, 
and include
: increasing hand hygiene compliance
 among staff, 
individual
s, and essential visitors through 
education and on
-the-spot coaching; 
and providing hand hygiene supplies at the entrance to the 
facility
. Additional critical control measures are 
described
 below.
 Monitoring
 Ask 
individual
s to 
report if they feel feverish or have symptoms of respiratory infection
 and COVID
-19
. Actively monitor all 
individual
s upon admission and at least three times daily for 
fever and respiratory symptoms 
and COVID
-19
 (including shortness of b
reath, 
new 
or 
worsening
 cough, and s
ore throat). If the 
individual
 has fever or symptoms, implement recommended 
infection prevention and control measures.
 For the SSLCs, HHSC recognizes that daily fever 
checks for every 
ind
ividual
 might pose a challenge and will educate surveyors accordingly.
 People with COVID
-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported 
Œ ranging from mild 
symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2
-14 days after exposure to the virus. 
People with th
ese symptoms may have COVID
-19:
 Ł Fever or chills
 Ł New or worsening c
ough
 Ł Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
 Ł Fatigue
 Ł Muscle or body aches
 Ł Headache
 Ł New loss of taste or smell
 Ł Sore throat
 Ł Congestion or runny nose
 Ł Nausea or vomiting
 Ł Diarrhea
 Isolation
 If a case of COVID
-19 is identified in the facility, immediate action must be taken to isolate the 
individual
 who is positive for COVID
-19 away from other 
individual
s. Symptoms of COVID
-19 can vary in severity. Initially, symptoms can be mild and
 not require 
transfer to a hospital if the facility can follow the infection prevention and control practices 
recommended by 
the 
CDC. 
Individual
s with known or suspected COVID
-19 do not need to be 
placed into an airborne infection isolation room but should
 be placed in a private room with their 
own bathroom
 if possible
.   January 
18, 2022
 Page

  If 
an individual
 requires a higher level of care or the facility cannot fully implement all 
recommended precautions, the 
individual
 should be transferred to another facility capable of 
imple
mentation. Transport personnel and the receiving facility should be notified about the 
suspected diagnosis prior to transfer. While awaiting transfer, symptomatic 
individual
s should 
wear a facemask (if tolerated) and be separated from others (kept in their
 room with the door 
closed). Appropriate PPE should be used by 
staff
 when encountering the 
individual
. Any roommates should be moved and monitored for fever and 
symptoms t
hree times a 
day (once 
each shift)
 per CDC guidance
. Room
-sharing might be necessary 
if there are multiple 
individual
s with known or suspected COVID
-19 in the facility. As roommates of symptomatic 
individual
s might already be exposed, it is generally not recommended to separate them in this 
scenario. Public health authorities can assist wi
th decisions about 
individual
 placement.
 Create a plan for cohorting 
individual
s with symptoms of 
respiratory infection
 and COVID
-19
, including dedicating 
DSP
 to work only on affected units
. Per the 
COVID
-19 rules
 and a
s part of 
the facility infection control plan, 
individual
s must
 be cohorted 
only with other 
individual
s who 
have the same COVID
-19
 status (positive, negative or unknown) and there should be designated 
staff for each cohort. Staff should not work with more than one cohort per shift or from day to 
day unless it™s 
required 
to provide
 necessary staffing coverage.
  If the 
individual
 is transferred to a higher level of care, perform a final, full clean of the room, 
and use an EPA
-registered disinfectant that has qualified under EPA™s emerging viral pathogens 
program for use against COVID
-19. These products can be found on EPA™s 
List N
. See 
attachment 10
 for actions to consider 
when isolating an individual with COVID
-19
. Source control
 The facility must
 create and
 implement infection prevention and control policies
. The facility may 
use CDC, CMS, and DSHS guidance to create infection prevention and control policies. The CDC 
recommends that a
ll 
individual
s who are ill should wear a facemask at all times as tolerated
, except for when they are eating or drinking, taking medications, or performing personal hygiene 
like bathing or oral care. If the 
individual
 cannot tolerate a surgical mask, personnel who enter 
the room must wear N95 respirators, if available and staff a
re fit
-tested. If they are not available 
or staff are not trained or fit
-tested, facemasks should be worn. Respiratory protection should be 
worn in addition to gown, gloves, and face shield. 
 Ensure staff have been appropriately trained and fit
-tested befo
re using N95 masks.
 See 
guidance in the section related to 
PPE use when caring for 
individual
s with COVID
-19
. If COVID
-19 is identified in the facility, have 
DSP
 wear 
all recommended PPE
 for care of all 
individual
s (regardless of symptoms) on the affected unit (or facility
-wide, depending on the 
situation). This includes: an N95 or 
higher
-level respirator
 (or facemask if a respirator is not 
available)
, eye protection, gloves, and gown. 
DSP
 should be trained on PPE use, including 
putting it on and taking it off.

  The CDC also recommends that
, in general, fully vaccinated staff should c
ontinue to wear source 
control while at work. However, fully vaccinated staff could dine and socialize together in break 
rooms and conduct in
-person meetings without source control or physical distancing. If 
unvaccinated staff are present, everyone should 
wear source control and unvaccinated staff 
should physically distance from others.
 Physical
 Distancing
 As per the most updated 
CDC guidance
: Ł If all indiv
iduals are fully vaccinated, then they may choose to have close contact
 and do 
not have to physically distance from other fully vaccinated people
.  Ł If unvaccinated individuals are present
 in the residence or participating in an activity
, then 
unvaccinated 
individuals should physically distance from others. 
  Quarantine
 The 
CDC guidance
 recommends that individuals be restricted to their bedroom if they are 
confirmed or suspected of having COVID
-19
. It 
does not recommend restricting individuals to 
their bedroom 
if they are not confirmed or suspected of having 
COVID
-19
. Except those who are 
fully vaccinated or fully recovered from COVID
-19, i
f an individual
 is a new 
admission or 
readmission, l
eaves the ICF 
overnight 
and returns
, has had known exposure or close cont
act 
with a person who is COVID
-19 positive, or who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID
-19 while 
awaiting test results
, the individual is con
sidered to have unknown COVID
-19 status. An 
individual who has not been fully vaccinated against COVID
-19 and is considered to have 
unknown COVID
-19 
status should
 be kept away from others while they are under observation. 
The individual should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of COVID
-19
.  [For 
new admissions or readmissions who are unvaccinated
, quarantine for 14 days is 
recommended if
:]  The 
individual
 ha
s not recovered from COVID
-19 within the last 90 days
, or  Has 
had 
close contact
 (within 6 feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 
24
-hour period
) with someone with confirmed COVID
-19 or are
a.   Quarantine is no 
longer recommended for individuals who are being admitted to an ICF if they 
are full vaccinated and asymptomatic.
] Individuals with unknown COVID
-19 status must be quarantined per CDC guidance
. For 
individual
s who 
have not been fully vaccinated against 
COV
ID-19
, the 
CDC still endorses a 
14
-day quarantine period
. It offers two 
alternatives and guidance
 to reducing quarantine time. 
Local public health authorities make th
e final decisions about how long quarantine should last, 

based on local conditions and needs. CDC™s two alternatives are:
   January 
18, 2022
 Page 
33
 of 
  33
   Alternative #1
 - Quarantine can end after Day 10 without testing if the person has no 
symptoms as determined by daily monitoring. 
  Alt
ernative #2
 - Quarantine can end after Day 7 if the person tests negative and has no 
symptoms as determined by daily monitoring. The test must occur on Day 5 or later. 
Quarantine cannot be discontinued earlier than after Day 7.
 Guidance includes the follow
ing information:
  Persons can discontinue quarantine at either 
alternative
 described above only if the 
following criteria are 
also met
:  o No COVID
-19 symptoms were detected by daily symptom monitoring during the 
entirety of quarantine up to the time at 
which quarantine is discontinued; and
 o Daily symptom monitoring continues through Day 14; and
 o Persons are counseled about the need to adhere strictly through Day 14 to all 
mitigation strategies, such as wearing a mask, avoiding crowds, practicing physical 

distancing, and practicing hand and cough hygiene. They should be advised that if 
any symptoms develop, they should immediately self
-isolate and contact their 
healthcare provider to report this change in clinical status.
  Testing under Alternative #2 above s
hould be considered only if it will have no impact on 
community diagnostic testing. Testing of persons seeking evaluation for an actual 
infection must be prioritized.
  Persons can continue to be quarantined for 14 days without testing per existing 
recommend
ations. This option is maximally effective.
 Both alternatives raise the risk of being a less effective than the 14
-day quarantine as currently 
recommended. However, the specific risks are as follows:
  For Alternative #1, the residual post
-quarantine transmi
ssion risk is estimated to be about 
1% with an upper limit of about 10%; and
  For Alternative #2, the residual post
-quarantine transmission risk is estimated to be about 
5% with an upper limit of about 12%.
 See 
Attachment 10
 for actions to consider when separat
ing an individual who might have been 
exposed to COVID
-19, including individuals whose status is unknown,
 and when 
the individual
 visits common areas.
 CDC guidance 
has 
changed
 related to quarantine for individual 
who are considered fully 
vaccinated against COVID
-19
. The CDC describes fully vaccinated individuals as an individual 
>2 weeks following receipt of the second dose in a 2
-dose series, or >2 weeks following receipt 
of o
ne dose of a single
-dose vaccine. 
Quarantine is no longer recommended for asymptomatic 
  January 
18, 2022
 Page 
34
 of 
  34
  fully vaccinated individuals who were exposed to COVID
-19 or those individuals who have had 
COVID
-19 infection in the prior 90 days.
 CDC Guidance changed related to 
quarantine for 
COVID
-19 
recovered 
individuals
. The CDC 
indicates that people who have tested 
positive 
and have subsequently recovered 
for 
COVID
-19 
do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to 90 days as long as they remain 
asymptomatic. Therefore, if a 
individual
 has recovered from COVID
-19 within the previous 90 
days, he or she does not have to be quarantined. The 
individual
 can 
return to the non
-quarantine area of the facility (e.g., cold zone or COVID
-19 negative cohort area) upon 
admission, readmission, or return to the facility. 
 The facility still needs to consider what additional precautions it should take for such 
individua
ls
, such as whether staff will wear full PPE when caring for individuals who have recently recovered 
from COVID
-19. The facility also can quarantine these individuals out of an abundance of caution 
if it has reasonable health and safety concerns. Additiona
lly, as the individual approaches 90 

days since illness onset, the facility should consider recent actions or interactions of the 
individual, such as participation in high
-risk activities or contact with persons who are confirmed 
or suspected of having COV
ID-19. This will help the facility determine the need for quarantine, 
as the 90
-day timeframe is not an absolute guarantee against transmission and long
-term care 
individuals
 are a high
-risk population.
 The CDC acknowledges that there is still uncertainty 
on contagiousness and susceptibility to 
reinfection with COVID
-19. At this time, the CDC cannot say for certain that there is no chance 
of reinfection in the 90
-day post recovery period. However, the CDC maintains that the risk of 
transmission in recovered
 persons is outweighed by the personal and societal benefits of 
avoiding unnecessary quarantine. 
 If a recovered individual experiences COVID
-19 symptoms at any point during the 90
-day post 
recovery period, he or she would need to be tested, quarantined, o
r isolated, depending on test 
result, as well as evaluated by an attending physician to determine whether it is a case of 
reinfection with COVID
-19 or another illness. 
 Reminder: There may be circumstances when Transmission
-Based Precautions (quarantine) f
or 
these individuals might be recommended (e.g., 
individual
 is moderately to severely 
immunocompromised, if the initial diagnosis of COVID
-19 might have been based on a false 
positive test result). 
 Please see the CDC™s 
When to Quarantine
 and Reinfection
 for more information.  
 Bathing
, Showering
, and Hygiene
 Individual
s with active signs and symptoms of respiratory illness 
and COVID
-19
 should remain in 
their bedroom while being evaluated and treated. However, care 
and services for other 
individual
s should 
continue 
with 
appropriate pre
cautions.
   January 
18, 2022
 Page 
35
 of 
  35
  Ideally, 
individual
s with COVID
-19 should be accommodated in a private
 bedroom
 with 
a private 
bathroom if at all possible
. If 
a private bathroom is not available
, the 
ICF
 should at least 
designate a bath
room
 that is separate from the ones used for 
individual
s who do 
not
 have 
COVID
-19.
 Alternately, the 
ICF could use other strategies for ensuring 
individual
 safety while delivering 
care, including 
staggering 
schedul
es for 
ind
ividual
 showering or bathing
. for 
individual
s with 
COVID
-19 so 
there would be less overlap with 
individual
s who do not have COVID
-19. 
 ICFs should continue to follow existing CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection of 
equipment and surfaces in shared spaces, like 
bathrooms
 or equipment that 
must
 be shared 
between 
individual
s, 
between every 
individual
 use, using the appropriate EPA
-approved 
products for COVID
-19 prevention. 
 DSPs should also be able to wear and maintain safe use of all recommended PPE while assisting 
individual
s with personal hygiene. Some PPE, including respirators and facemasks, could be
 compromised if they get wet.
 Individual
s who 
can
 bathe independently
 - If 
an individual
 is able to 
bathe
 independently,
 they should continue to do so.
 Individual
s who need assistance to bathe
 - If 
an individual
 nee
ds assistance with bathing 
and:  the 
indiv
idual
 has COVID
-19 and is symptomatic or asymptomatic, 
DSP
 must also be able 
to wear and maintain safe use of all recommended PPE while assisting 
individual
s with 
personal hygiene; or
  the 
individual
 has recovered from COVID
-19, per the test
-based or non
-test-based 
strategy (or otherwise)
, OR the 
individual
 has consistently tested negative and is 
asymptomatic, follow established policies and procedures for other care that requires 
close contact for bathing and showering
. Cleaning and disinfecting the bathing
 or shower area 
- If 
individual
s with COVID
-19 have 
access to a private bathroom or only share a bathroom with other 
individual
s who have the 
same COVID
-19 status, the 
ICF should clean and sanitize the bathroom frequently.
 If the 
bathroom
 is shared by both 
individual
s who have COVID
-19 and those 
who 
don™t, clean 
and disinfect the area 
between every 
individual
 use. Individual
 education 
- Educate 
individual
s and any essential visitors regarding the importance 
of handwashing. Assist 
individua
ls in performing hand hygiene if they are unable to do so 
themselves. Education should also be provided to 
individual
s to cover their coughs and sneezes 
with a tissue, then throw the tissue away in the trash and wash their hands. If individuals are 

unable 
to understand or perform the appropriate hygiene, DSPs should assist as necessary.

  Recovery
 Establish 
an individual
 recovery plan, including when 
an individual
 is considered recovered and 
next steps for care. A recovery plan is the guidance for determining
 when to discontinue 
transmission
-based precautions and continued are of 
an individual
. The recovery plan may be 
different depending on whether a test
-based or non
-test
-based strategy is used. Criteria should 
include:
 Ł Discontinuation of transmission
-based 
precautions without
 testing.
 Ł Discontinuation of transmission
-based precautions with
 testing.
 Ł Whether using a testing
-based strategy for discontinuation of transmission
-based 
precautions is
 preferred.
 Discontinuation of Tran
smission
-Based 
Precautions for I
ndividuals with 
COVID
-19 The decision to 
discontinue
 transmission
-based precautions
 for 
individual
s with confirmed 
COVID
-19 infection
 should be made using a symptom
-base
d strategy as described below.
 The 
time period 
since symptoms first appeared
 depends on the 
individual
™s severity of illness
, and if 
they
 are severely immunocompromised.
 A test
-based strategy is no longer recommended
, 
except as noted below
.   Symptom
-Based Strategy for 
Discontinuing Transmission
-Based Precautions
 Individual
s with
 mild to moderate illness
 who are not severely immunocompromised:
  At least 10 days have passed
 since symptoms first appeared
 and
  At least 24 hours have passed
 since last
 fever without the use of 
fever

medications
 and
  Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved
  Individual
s with

improved
 Test
-Based Strategy for Discontinuing Transmission
-Based Precautions.
 In some instances, a test
-based strategy could b
e considered for discontinuing transmission
-based p
recautions earlier than if the symptom
-based strategy were used. A test
-based 
strategy 
could also be considered for some 
individual
s (e.g., those who are severely 
immunocompromised) in consultation with local infectious diseases experts
 if concerns exist 
about
 the 
individual
 being infectious for more than 20 days.
   January

  The criteria for t
he test
-based strategy are:
 Individual
s who are symptomatic:
  Resolution of fever without the use of fever
-reducing medications
 and
  Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved,
 and
  Results are negative from at least two consecutive 
PCR tests a
t least 
24 hours apart
 Individual
s who are not symptomatic:
  Results are negative from at least two consecutive 
PCR tests at least 24 hours apart
 Control Measures for Staff
 Active screening
 The CDC and CMS recommend IC
Fs screen all staff prior to entering t
he facility at the beginning 
of their shift 
in 
in accordance with HHSC guidance
.  Actively take their temperature and 
document shortness of breath, 
new or
 worsening
 cough
, and sore throat. 
If they are ill, 
immediately send them home to self
-isolate. For the SSLCs, HHSC recognizes that documenting 
the absence of symptoms on all staff daily might pose a challenge and will educate surveyors 
accordingly.
 Staffing contingency plan
 Develop a staffing contingency p
lan in case a large number of staff must self
-quarantine or 
isolate because of potential exposure, being suspected of, or positive for COVID
-19. 
ICF
s must:
 Ł have sufficient 
direct care 
staff 
to manage and supervise 
individual
s in accordance with 
their indiv
idual program plans 
- 42 CFR
 §483.430(d)(1)
; Ł have an active program for the prevention, control, and investigation of infection and 
communi
cable diseases 
- 42 CFR
 §483.470(l)(1)
; and
 Ł develop and maintain an emergency preparedness plan that is based on a 
facility
-based 
and community
-based risk assessment, utilizing
 an all
-hazards approach, and includes 
emerging infectious disease 
- 42 CFR
 §48
3.475(a)
. Hand H
ygiene and PPE
 Hand
 hygiene 
- Reinforce the importance of hand hygiene among all facility staff, including any 
contract staff. Facilities can increase the frequency of hand hygiene audits and implement short 
in
-service sessions on the prope
r technique for hand hygiene.
 Ensure that supplies for performing hand hygiene are readily available and easily accessible by 
staff. Advise staff not to keep hand sanitizer bottles in their pockets. This practice causes hands 
and sanitizer bottles to becom
e contaminated. Instead, consider keeping alcohol
-based hand rub 
(ABHR) bottles in easily accessible areas and in different rooms throughout the facility.
   January 
18, 2022
 Page

 of 
  38
  PPE 
- Ensure the facility maintains an adequate supply of PPE and that all required PPE is easily 
accessible to staff entering 
individual
 rooms. For 
individual
s with COVID
-19, CDC recommends 
staff adhere to standard and transmission
-based precautions. If the fac
ility does not have a 
supply of N95 respirators, 
or does not have any fit
-tested staff, 
facemasks should be worn for 
droplet protection. 
Follow the CDC 
Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations 
for Patients with Sus
pected or Confirmed COVID
-19 in Healthcare Settings
, which includes 
detailed information regarding recommended PPE.
 Consider designating staff to steward these supplies and encourage appropriate use by staff and 
individual
s. PPE and Infection Control Educa
tion and Training 
- Ensure staff are educated and trained 
on which PPE they should use, proper procedure for donning (putting on) and doffing (taking off) 

PPE, and how to determine if the PPE is contaminated or damaged.
 ICFs must identify whether the follo
wing concerns exist and specifically address them through 
education and training:
 Ł Improper use of
 PPE
: o lack of understanding of proper use of each type of
 PPE; o lack of fit
-testing (see 
PPE Use When Caring for 
Individual
s with COVID
-19
); and/or
 o lack of user seal
 check
. Ł Improper donning and doffing procedures
: o lack of understanding of appropriate donning and doffing sequence
; o safety
 and quality control
 measures
; and/or
 o lack of appropriate donning and doffing
 locations
. Ł Cross
 contamination
: o lack of understanding of cold, warm
, and hot zones within
 a facility
; o cold zone 
- area with no COVID
-19 infection
 present
; o warm 
zones 
- area used to monitor 
individual
s suspected of COVID
-19 infection
; and/or
 o hot zones 
- area where COVID
-19 infection is
 present
. If the 
ICF is following the 
CDC's
 or DSHS™
 guidance for optimizing the sup
ply of PPE, inform staff 
of the expectations specific to the type of PPE they are using. PPE education and training for 

staff should include at least the following information:
 Ł PPE 
Œ simple, easy to understand training that
 includes:
 o use of PPE in a
n IC
F without
 a known positive case of
 COVID
-19
; o use of PPE in a
n IC
F with
 a suspected or positive case of
 COVID
-19

 Dedicated staff/COVID
-19 response
 teams 
- Staff caring for 
individuals
 in a COVID
-19 
positive or unknown COVID
-19 status cohort area 
should 
be fit
-tested for N95 respirators and 
prepared to provide an advanced level of care for cases if necessary, or until 
individual
s with 
COVID
-19 
can be transferred to a higher level of care. COVID
-19 care teams can be 
implemented if not all staff can be trained and fit
-tested for N95 
mask
s, or if supplies of 
them
 are insufficient to equip the entire staff. 
See guidance in the sectio
n related to 
PPE use when 
caring for 
individual
s with COVID
-19
. Restrict staff movement between facilities 
-. The facility must develop and implement a 
policy regarding staff working with other lo
ng
-term care (LTC) providers
 that limits the sharing 
of staff with other LTC providers and facilities, unless required in order to maintain adequate 
staffing at a
 facility.
 Sick leave
 - Facilities should review and potentially revise their sick leave polic
ies. Staff who are 
ill should not come to work. Sick leave policies that do not penalize staff with loss of status, 
wages, or benefits will encourage staff who are ill to stay home.
 Work exclusion
 Œ Staff who are confirmed or suspected to have COVID
-19 mus
t stay at home. 
See below for guidance on when they may return to work.
 [Quarantine
 Options
 for Staff
] [The criteria for when an employee can return to work depends on whether the employee has 
symptoms of COVID
-19 or has been diagnosed with COVID
-19 and is
 in isolation, or whether the 
employee has been exposed to COVID
-19 and requires quarantine.

OR  at least 7 days since the date of exposure (day 0) 
when 
the 
DSP
 remains asymptomatic 
and the 
DSP tests negative via antig
en or PCR test. The 
DSP
 should be tested within 48 
hours prior to returning to work (in anticipation of testing delays).
]    [The provider must determine what steps are necessary to protect the health and safety of the 
individual in quarantine, as well as 
the health and safety of other employees 
and individual
s. If 
an employee returns to work following a reduced quarantine period, facilities can require the 
employee to wear full PPE regardless of where the individual works in the 
ICF

] Test
-Based Strategy for Discontinuing
 Transmissi

 In some instances, a test
-based strategy could be considered for discontinuing transmission
-based precautions earlier than if the symptom

-based strategy 
could also be considered for some 
DSP
 (e.g., thos
e who are severely immunocompromised) in 
consultation with local infectious diseases experts
 if concerns exist about the 
DSP being 
infectious for more than 20 days.
 The criteria for the test
-based strategy are:
 DSP who are symptomatic:
  Resolution of 
fever without the use of fever
-reducing medications
 and
  Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved,
 and
  Results are negative from at least two consecutive PCR tests at least 24 hours apart
 DSP who are not symptomatic:
  Results are negative fr
om at least two consecutive PCR tests at least 24 hours apart
 Note: If the employee was diagnosed with a different illness (e.g., influenza) and was never 
tested for COVID
-19, base their return to work on the criteria associated with that diagnosis.
 [Boost
ed Staff (Asymp

] [DSP are considered ﬁboostedﬂ if they have received all COVID
-19 vaccine doses, including a 
booster dose, as recommended by CDC.  At this time, boosted staff with higher

ted from work, as long as they test negative 
immediately (but not earlier than 24 hours after the exposure, and, if negative again 5

] [Higher
-risk exposure refers to 
exposure of an individual™s eyes, nose, or mouth to material 
potent
ially containing COVID

procedure. This can occur when staff do not wear adequate personal protective equipment 

during care or interaction with an individual.

]  Reporting COVID
-19
 All ICFs are required to report to HHSC CII within 24 hours of:
  A facility™s 
first
 positive case of COVID
-19 in staff or
 individuals
, or
  A new 
positive case of COVID
-19 after a facility has been without new cases for 14 days 
or more.
 Do not report COVID
-19 positive cases to HHSC CII outside of the two reportable 
events listed above.
 A facility must not report any additional COVID
-19 positive case
s to HHSC 
CII after the first positive case has been reported, unless the facility has been COVID
-19 free for 
14 days. Additionally, the reportable events listed above do not include a 
individual
 who was 
admitted to the facility with an active COVID
-19 inf
ection or a 
individual
 who developed COVID
-19 within 14 days of being admitted to the facility.  A decision tree can be found on 
Attachment 
11
. If a facility has a new reportable COVID
-19 positive case, and has not reported
 a COVID
-19 
positive case to HHSC within the past 14 days, the facility must:
  report the case to HHSC CII using one of these three methods: 
 o the Texas Unified Licensure Information Portal (TULIP), 
 o by email to 
ciicomplaints@hhs.texas.gov
 or  o by calling 1

HHSC CII.
 Outbreak Management
 If an outbreak of COVID
-19 is suspected or identifie
d in your facility, strict measures must be 
put in place to halt disease transmission.
 Outbreak definitions 
Œ A confirmed outbreak of COVID
-19 is defined as one or more 
laboratory confirmed cases of COVID
-19 identified in either 
an individual
 or paid/unpai
d staff. 
All 
confirmed outbreaks will be reported to the LHD or PHR immediately, or DSHS when a LHD or 
PHR are not available in that region.
 A suspected outbreak is defined as one or more cases of respiratory illness within a one
-week 
period without a posi
tive test for COVID
-19. Use the suspected outbreak definition if your facility 
is awaiting test results from either 
an individual
 or paid/unpaid staff. You can contact your local 
  January 
18, 2022
 Page 
44
 of 
  44
  health authority for assistance during this period but are not required to re
port suspected 
outbreaks. If you suspect 
an individual
 or staff member might have COVID
-19, do not wait for 
test results to implement outbreak control measures.
 If you have two or more 
individual
s or staff with similar symptoms, report to your local health
 authority (or DSHS when there is no local health authority) as you would for any other cluster of 
illness.
 For 
Individuals
: Facility
-onset COVID
-19 infections must originate in the facility more than 14 
days after admission to be considered an outbreak. 
 Ł For example, a current 
individual
 (who is past their 
14
-day post admission period) that 
tests positive IS considered outbreak. 
 This definition does not include 
individuals
 who were known to have COVID
-19 infection upon 
admission and were placed on transmission
-based precautions. Nor does the definition include 
individuals
 who were placed on transmission
-based precautions upon admission and developed 
COVID
-19 infection withi
n 14 days after admission. These exceptions would not constitute 
outbreak criteria. 
 For DSP
: A recent positive COVID
-19 test would be considered an outbreak for the facility, if 
the DSP was at work during their infectious period. 
 
Based on the CDC definit
ion of close contact, if the infected DSP was at the facility any time 
during the two days before their positive test result, or two days before symptom onset, then 
they were at the facility during their infectious period and that would be considered an ou
tbreak. 
 However, if the DSP tests positive, but has not been at the facility for more than two days before 
their positive test result, or two days before symptom onset, then that does not qualify as an 
outbreak.
 Maintain a low threshold of suspicion for C
OVID
-19, as early 
symptoms can be non
-specific and 
include atypical presentations such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, among others.
 Implement universal use of facemask
s for 
DSP while inside the facility.
 Follow the 
CDC
™s guidance
 for optimizing the supply of facemasks
 when deciding how long staff should wear one 
facemask. Masks should be discarded upon exit, and a new mask should be worn upon
 reentry.
 Note that h
omemade facemasks should only be used when all other options have bee
n entirely 
exhausted and should only be used as source control.
 These masks are not considered 
protective.
 Consider having 
DSP wear all recommended PPE for COVID
-19 (gown, gloves, eye protection, 
a facemask or N95
) for the care of all 
individual
s, regardle
ss of presence of symptoms. Implement 
protocols for extended use of eye protection and facemasks. Refer to DSHS™ 
strategies for
 optimizing the supply of PPE
.   January 
18, 2022
 Page

 of 
  45
  Implement protocols for cohorting positive COVID
-19 cases with dedicated 
DSP
. These 
DSP should be appropriately trained and fit
-tested for N95 masks if at all possible. 
If staff cannot be 
fit
-tested for N95s, they should NOT use them and use facemasks inst
ead. Consider designating 
entire units within the facility, with dedicated DSP, to care for known or suspected COVID
-19 
cases. 
See guidance in section related to 
PPE use when caring for 
individual
s with COVID
-19
. Movement and monitoring decisions for 
DSP
 with exposure to COVID
-19 should be made in 
consultation with local public health authorities. To learn more, refer to the CDC™s 
Interim U.S. 
Guidance for Risk Assessment 
and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with 
Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with COVID
-19
. Maintain a line list of all confirmed and suspected COVID
-19 cases within your facility. Include 
details such as name, date of b
irth, age, gender, whether staff or 
individual
, room number 
(shared or private) 
or job description, date of symptom onset, fever, symptoms, and others. If 
your facility does not already have a 
line list template
, you can find one
 on the DSHS website.
 PPE Use When Caring for 
Individual
s with COVID
-19 DSP should wear an N95 respirator and all suggested PPE when caring for 
individual
s with 
COVID
-19. If there is widespread COVID
-19 infection in the building, staff should wear an N95 
respirator and all suggested PPE 
when caring for 
individual
s. Per the CDC, ﬁall suggested PPEﬂ includes:
  N95 respirator
;  eye protection
;  gloves
; and
  gown
. Cloth gowns 
- Follow manufacturer™s recommendations for cleaning and laundering, including 
the number of times the gown can be laundered and re
-worn. This 
might 
differ by manufacturer 
and type of cloth gown. Immediately remove the gown to be laundered if i
t becomes soiled.
 Certain types of gowns, sometimes called Level 1 or ﬁminimal riskﬂ gowns, do not provide 

protection from splashes/sprays of blood or body fluids, depending on the material the gown is 

made of. For these situations:
  Use a disposable, imper
vious isolation gown when a splash, spray
, or cough might be 
expected.
  If 
an IC
F does not have disposable, impervious isolation gowns, use a disposable plastic 
apron over the cloth gown in these situations.
 The 
ICF also 
should train staff on how to correct
ly don/doff any cloth or other alternative 
isolation gown; include a competency check.
 Review the CDC™s 
Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Isolation Gowns
 for more information.

  N95 respirator fit testing 
- Under serious outbreak conditions in which respirator supplies are 
severely limited, 
DSP
 may not have the opportunity to be fit
-tested on a respirator before using 
it. 
ICFs should make every effort to ensure 
DSPs
 who need to us
e tight
-fitting respirators are fit
-tested to identify the right respirator for the 
DSP
. Under serious outbreak conditions, there may 
be limited availability of respirators or fit
-test kits.
 If 
ICFs cannot fit
-test 
DSPs
 for N95 respirators, they should follow the
 NIOSH guidance
 for 
respirator use in a serious outbreak.
 While it is not ideal, even without fit
-testing, a respirator will provide better protection than a 
facemask 
or using no respira
tor at all. IC
Fs should assist the 
DSP
 in choosing a respirator that 
fits best.
 Even if 
DSPs
 begin using respirators without proper fit
-testing, 
ICFs should make every effort to 
perform fit
-testing as respirator supplies allow. 
ICFs should always perform f
it
-testing for 
workers who cannot successfully seal check their own respirators. 
 DSPs
 should review the following 
OSHA Respiratory Protection Training Videos
: Ł Respiratory Protection for Healthcare Workers

 User Seal Check 
- DSPs
 wearing tight
-fitting respiratory protection should perform a 
user seal 
check
 each time they put on their r
espirator. A fit test ensures that the respirator fits and 
provides a secure seal. A user seal check ensures that it™s being worn right each time.
 DSPs
 can either perform a positive
-pressure or negative
-pressure seal check:
 Ł A positive
-pressure check is acc
omplished by covering the respirator surface on a filtering 
facepiece (N95) and trying to breathe out. Cover the surface using your hands. If slight 
pressure builds up, that means air isn™t leaking around the edges of the respirator.

 The seal check method may vary by manufacturer and model and will be des
cribed in the user

 Expansion of Reopening Visitation
 ICFs are required to allow indoor visits, outdoor visits, end
-of-life visits, and visits of persons 
providing critical assistance, including essential caregivers for individuals.
 Any 
reference to ""indoor visits"" and ""outdoor visits"" refer to visits between an individual and a 
personal visitor. Essential caregiver and end
-of-life visits can also occur indoors or outdoors but 
are referred to as essential caregiver visits or end
-of-life v
isits.
 As a reminder, an ICF is required to screen all visitors for signs or symptoms of COVID
-19. A 
visitor may not participate in a visit if the visitor has signs and symptoms of COVID
-19 or active 
COVID
-19 infection.
 Visitation Requirements
 The followin
g applies to all visitations.
  An ICF must:
 Ł develop and enforce policies and procedures that ensure infection control practices, 
including whether the visitor and the individual must wear a face mask, face covering, or 
appropriate PPE;
 Ł ensure equal access 
by all individuals to personal visitors, end
-of-life visitors, and 
essential caregivers; 
 Ł allow visitors of any age; 
 Ł ensure a comfortable and safe outdoor visitation area for outdoor visits, considering 

outside air temperature and ventilation;
 Ł inform visi
tors of the facility™s infection control policies and procedures related to 
visitation;
 Ł limit the movement of the visitor through the facility to ensure interaction with other 
persons in the facility is minimized; and
 Ł provide hand
-washing stations, or hand
 sanitizer, to the visitor and individual before and 
after visits. 
 Visitation must be facilitated to allow time for cleaning and sanitization of the visitation area 

between visits and to ensure infection prevention and control measures are followed. An IC
F can 
allow both scheduled and unscheduled visits
 but should not require scheduled visits in such a 
way as to 
prohibit or limit visitation for individuals. 
 The individual and his or her personal visitor may have close or personal contact in accordance 
with CDC guidance.
 For essential caregiver requirements, see 
Essential Caregiver Visits
. Visits are permitted where adequate space is available
, including in the individual's room,
 to 
ensure physical distancing between visitation groups and safe infection prevention and
 control 
measures. 
   January 
18, 2022
 Page

  The visitor and the individual must practice hand hygiene before and after the visit.
 Essential Caregiver Visits
 An essential caregiver visit is defined as a personal visit between an individual and a designated 
essential caregiver, per
mitted in all facilities for all individuals with any COVID
-19 status.
 An ICF must allow essential caregiver visits. The following requirements apply to essential 

caregiver visits:
 Ł Up to two essential caregivers can be designated per individual and up to t
wo essential 
caregivers can visit each individual at the same time. 
 Ł An essential caregiver visit is not allowed if the visitor has signs or symptoms of COVID

 Holiday Visitations & Other Considerations
 Bringing Food During Visitation
 Visitors are not prohibited from bringing in outside food for an individual. 
 Individuals may eat or drink during the visit.
 Visitors can bring outside food for an individual. An ICF facilitates indoor and outdoor visitation 
between personal visitors and 
individuals according to CDC guidance.
 The facility should refer to CDC guidance on 
Food Safety
 for food brought in from the outside for 
an individual.
 The C
DC provides the following about 
food safety
:  The risk of infection by the virus from food products, food packaging, or bags is thought 
to be very low. 
  Currently, no cases of COVID
-19 have been identified where infection was thought to have 
occurred by touching food, food packaging, or shopping bags.
  Do NOT use disinfectants designed for hard surfaces, such as bleach or ammonia, on food 
packaged in cardboard or plastic wrap.
  After handling food packages and before eating food, always wash your hands with soap 
and water for at least 20 seconds. If 
soap and water are not available, use a hand 
sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
 Visitors may bring items, including food, for an individual during a visit.
 For essential caregivers, the facility informs the essential caregiver of the necessary i
nfection 
control and food safety protocols for delivered items. The essential caregiver can deliver the 
items directly to the individual. 
 The CDC shared information on 
Food and COVID
-19
 that reviewed
 risks from food or packaging 
and handling packaged food and produce.
 Facility
 Activities and Outings
 ICFs planning facility
-coordinated group activities, including holiday meals, should
 ensure the 
following:
  Perf
orm hand hygiene before and after activity
  Clean and sanitize the activity area and all items used before and after each activity
   January 
18, 2022
 Page 
53
 of 
  53
  Individuals have the right to make the informed decision to leave the facility for a holiday 
activity.
 As per the most updated
 CDC guidance
: Ł If all individuals participating in the communal dining or group activity are fully vaccinated, 
then they may choose to have close contact
 and do not have to physically distance from 
other fully vaccinated people
. Ł If unvaccinated individuals are present, then unvaccinated individuals should physically 
distance from others.
 [Per CMS and CDC, the safest approach is for everyone, regardless of 
vaccination status, to 
wear a face covering or mask while in communal areas of the facility.]
  Quarantining Specifics
 when Leaving the Home
 An individual who leaves the facility, who is not gone overnight and who did not have contact 
with others who may potentially have COVID
-19 or are confirmed to have COVID
-19, does not 
have to be quarantined upon returning to the facility. 
 
 Quarantine is n
o longer recommended for individuals who
 leave the facility and return
 when they 
have been fully vaccinated against COVID
-19
.  According to the CDC™s 
When to Quaranti
ne
, anyone who has surpassed their 90
-day post 
recovery period after having had COVID
-19 should still quarantine if exposed to the virus or 
symptomatic
, until or if they become fully vaccinated
. 
The 90
-day timeframe is not an absolute 
guarantee against tra
nsmission and long
-term care individuals are a high
-risk population.
 Packages and Receivable Items (i.e.
, gifts)
 Individuals may receive items, including food, flowers, and packages, from family members or 
persons other than a scheduled visitor. For items 
delivered outside of a personal visit, facilities 
should designate an outside area for food and other items to be delivered. 
 Facility staff would retrieve the items, bring them inside, and disinfect them prior to delivering 
the items to the individuals. F
acilities should follow CDC guidance for appropriate disinfecting 
guidelines, depending on what the items are. 
 For handling non
-food items, the CDC recommends hand washing after handling items delivered 
or after handling mail.
 Per the CDC, although COVID
-19 can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely 
to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging. 
 It may be possible to get COVID
-19 by touching an object that has the virus on it and then 
touching your mouth, no
se, or eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus 
spreads.

 COVID
-19 Vaccinations
 Reporting
 In accordance with 
emergency rules 
at 26 TAC §
551.48
, ICF facilities except SSLCs must report 
the following data to
 HHSC within 24 hours of completing a round of vaccinations: 
  Aggregate numbers of staff 
Œ including employees, contractors, and volunteers 
Œ who 
received their first dose of a two
-dose COVID
-19 vaccine or their only dose of a single
-dose COVID
-19 vaccine;
   Aggregate numbers of staff 
Œ including employees, contractors, and volunteers 
Œ who 
received their second dose of a two
-dose COVID
-19 vaccine;
  Aggregate numbers of 
individuals
 who received their first dose of a two
- dose COVID
-19 
vaccine or their only dose of a single
-dose COVID
-19 vaccine; and 
  Aggregate numbers of 
individuals 
who received their second dose of a two
-dose COVID
-19 
vaccine.
  Aggregate numbers of individuals and st
aff who received their COVID
-19 booster vaccine. 
 Reporting Guidance
 Method: 
HHSC has developed a Survey Monkey tool to collect this information. HHSC 
issued an alert containing the survey link on February 12, and the link to the ICF survey is 
posted on th
e ICF provider portal under the COVID
-19 resource accordion. You can access 
the ICF survey at 
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/95FQ52S
. Multiple locations: 
Submit a separate survey for each license numbe
r. For example, a 
provider that owns multiple licenses would submit separate surveys for each license
. Frequency: 
Complete the survey only when you have information to report, i.e., when a 
round of vaccines is administered to staff or 
individuals
. On days 
when no vaccines are 
administered, you do not need to complete the survey. 
Note: If reporting vaccination rounds 
that occurred previously, complete a separate survey by date for each previous separate 

round
. First report: 
If a round of 
vaccinations was administered before the effective date of this 
letter, submit a report to capture those vaccinations
. Parameters: 
Reports are for a given round of vaccinations administered by the facility or a 
pharmacy partner. Do not provide cumulative numbers. In other words, do not include totals 

from previous reports in a new 
report. 
Report all vaccinations, including those 
that 
occurred 
at an off
-site pharmacy, doctor™s office, local mass vaccination clinic, etc.

  CMS QSO 21
-21
 As per 
CMS QSO 21
-21
, effective May 21, 2021, CMS added new requirements at 42 CFR 
§483.460(a)(4) directing 
each 
ICF/IID to develop policies and procedures to educate clients, 
their representatives, and staff on the benefits and risks and potential side effects of the COVID
-19 vaccine. Further, the ICF/IID must offer the vaccine unless i
t is medically contraindicated, or 
the client or staff member has already been immunized. In this context, offer means that the 
ICF must facilitate the provision of the COVID
-19 vaccine to individuals and staff members who 
choose to receive it. The facilit
y can administer the vaccine itself or take individuals and staff to 
an external vaccine provider. Additionally, the facility must maintain appropriate documentation 
to reflect the provision of the required COVID
-19 vaccine education and offering, and whet
her 
the client and staff member received the vaccine or did not receive it due to medical 

contraindications or refusal.
 Surveyors should expect to see documentation of the facility offering the vaccine to individuals 
and staff as required by HHCS ICF COVID
-19 emergency rules as of March 23, 2021. ICFs are 
only expected to document the CMS QSO 21
-21 required education and offering of the vaccine 
to individuals and staff members as of the effective date of the rule, May 21, 2021. 
 Noncompliance related to the
 new requirements for educating and offering COVID
-19 vaccination 
to clients and staff will be cited at W
-tags 500
-507.

 Things to Consider when an 
Individual in Quarantine 
Visits
 Common Areas of the 
home
  Isolate in a private bedroom with the 
use of a private bathroo
m if possible;
  Consider whether other rooms in the 
ICF can be used as a bedroom during 

an isolation emergency;
  Consider whether a bathroom can be 
reserved only for the use of the 
individual with COVID
-19, possibly the 
one closest to the bedroom;
  Consider c
ohorting (accommodating in 
same bedroom) with another 
individual who also has COVID
-19;
  Do 
not
 cohort with another individual 
who does not have COVID
-19 or 
whose status is unknown;
  Maintain at least 6 feet distance 
between individual™s beds, or more if 

pos
sible, for individuals who are 
cohorting in the same room;
  Increase cleaning and disinfection of 

the bedroom, including commonly 
touched surfaces and equipment;
  Increase cleaning and disinfection of 

the bathroom, including after each use 
by the individual 
with COVID
-19 if a 
bathroom cannot be dedicated only for 

use by the individual with COVID
-19;
  Keep the bedroom door closed when 

at all possible;
  Have everyone with COVID
-19 wear a 
facemask always, as tolerated; and
  Educate individuals about hand 

hygiene, c
overing coughs and 
sneezes, and properly discarding used 

tissues.
  Consider whether other rooms in

  Consider cohorting an individual 

who might have been exposed 
with another individual who also 

has
 been exposed;
  Consider cohorting an individual 
whose status is unknown with 
another individual whose status is 
unknown;
  Do 
not

19 Committee at each center to both manage all aspects of the COVID
-
19 
response and to s
upport the 
general 
work of existing Infection Control Committees; 
 

 
Re
-
education of all residents and staff on hand hygiene, including hand hygiene after contact with 
respiratory secretions, with regular reinforcement; 
 

 
Re
-
education of all staff on cleaning
 
and disinfection procedures, with regular reinforcement; 
 

 
Enhanced and more frequent cleaning of highly trafficked areas and surfaces; 
 

 
Re
-
enforcement of universal precautions and social distancing, to the extent practical based on person
-
centered needs; 
 

 
Adjustment of staffing patterns to ensure critical services are provided while reducing the number of 
individuals that pass through resident areas;

Each center resident is monitored multiple times each day for signs and symptoms of COVID
-
19.  Any changes in 
health are immediately 
reviewed by healthcare professionals and appropriate 
actions and 
care provided.  In 
addition, each 
center 
complies with
 
dai
ly COVID
-
19 reporting requirements to their local health departments.
 
 
The centers are prepared in the event of a staffing shortage
 
whether it would be related to weather, COVID
-
19 or 
any other reason.  The centers have the ability to hire
 
temporary staff 
as needed
, re

Visits Outside of the Center
 
Regardless o
f vaccination status, residents may engage in visits outside of the center with family and friends for any 
duration.  In all cases, residents and the family or friends taking them on an off
-
site visit will be directed by the center 
to follow infection cont
rol practices including source control, physical distancing, hand hygiene, etc. and to 
encourage those around them while on a visit to do the same.  
Additionally, center residents may participate in 
community outings with center staff.
  
 
 
With the exception of 
in
-
patient 
hospitalization
, 
quarantine upon return may not be required 
in most circumstances 
for fully vaccinated residents who leave the facility for less than 24 hours 
or fully vaccinated residents who leave the 
facility for more th
an 24 hours 
and
 
do not have close contact with someone with COVID
-
19 infection.
  
Unvaccinated 
residents engaging in an off
-
site visit for any duration may be required to quarantine upon return based on factors 
such as the rate of community spread of COVID
-
19 in the area, reports that the resident had close contact with 
someone with COVID
-

hand washing, etc.
 
 
Upon return to the center the resident or
 
the person returning them from their visit
 
should
 
report close contact 
-
 
defined as 
15 or more cumulative minutes within 24
-
hours 

 
with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID
-
19 or
 
if
 
the resident 
has symptoms consistent with COVID
-
19.  If the resident 
had a close contact
, 
the resident will 
be 

Quarantine
 
Area for 14 days
 
from date of 
exposure
 
and, as medically advisable, test negative for COVID
-
19 before returning to their regula
r living area.  If the 
resident tests positive for COVID
-
19, they would move to an Active Positive 
Resident (Isolation) 
Area.  Upon recovery, 
they would then move to a Recovered Positive Resident Area.  
As with other visits, off
-
site visits must be 
presche
duled with the center so that the facility 
is able to manage the availability of 
isolation space (if needed) for 
the resident upon return.
 
 
If the resident has symptoms consistent with COVID
-
19, they should be tested for same 
and evaluated by medical staff
 
to determine if they may return to their residence or further action needs to be taken.
 
 
 
Please note that in situations where visits are not possible, accommodations will be provided for End

true negative
)
.
 
 
All center staff are required to wear a face mask and other PPE 
while working.  The
 
type of face mask and PPE
 
utilized
 
is dependent on the setting within the center.  All staff are trained on proper donning and doffing of PPE with regular

Those residents who had severe/critical illness or who are severely immunocompromised 
may need to isolate 
longer.
 
 
Resident
 
Quarantine 
Area
 
An area used for residents who have gone off grounds for a medical appointment, emergency room visit, 
hospitalization
 
or have presented with symptoms
 
that could be compatible with
 
COVID

19 infection
 
while awaiting 
evaluati
on
. 
 
 
With the exception of 
in

patient 
hospitalization
, quarantine upon return 
from an off grounds interaction 
may not be 
required 
in most circumstances 
for fully vaccinated residents who leave the facility for less than 24 hours 
or fully 
vaccinated residents who leave the facility for more than 24 hours 
and
 
do not have close contact with someone with 
COVID
-
19 infection.
  
Unvaccinated residents engaging in an off

social distancing, hand washing, etc.
 
 
Residents 
who are determined to need 
quarantine 
remain in this area until 
they
 
are for at least 14 days 
and
 
have 
been tested for COVID
-
19.    If they test negative, the resident is returned to their regular 
living 
area.  If they test 
positive
 
at any time

below:
 
 

 
Any center resident or staff who has tested positive for COVID
-
19, has met the stan
dard for recovery and 
is asymptomatic will not require testing for 90 days following their first
 
positive test and/or symptom 
onset.  This is based on CDC guidance 
stating that for those who remain asymptomatic following recovery, 
testing is not recommended if another exposure occurs or might have occurred within 90 days after the 
date of symptom onset from the initial COVID
-

T THIS DOCUMENT
 
This plan was developed by the New Hampshire (NH) Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS), Division of Public Health Services (DPHS), Bureau of Infectious Disease Control, 
Immunization Program. 
The planning process to develop this pl
an included a variety of internal and 
external stakeholders. 
Content included in this plan was adapted, in part, from the Centers for 

Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations
, 
prior pandemic and outb
reak event experience in New Hampshire
, preparedness plans
, and other 
resources
.
 
The format and content of this plan is in accordance with the specific elements required 
to be addressed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 
The COVID
-
19 vaccin
e planning 
process has required flexibility as guidance and planning assumptions continue to evolve. This plan 
is intended to represent current plans and strategies as of the date of the document; however, DPHS

and ensure NH citiz
ens remain healthy and free from disease in every stage of life. This plan was 
developed by the NH Department of Health and Human Services
 
(DHHS)
, Immunization Program 
(NHIP) 

Vaccination Prog
ram 
Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations
, prior pandemic and outbreak experience in NH,

s
 
strategies related to equitable dose distribution. 
Ensuring 
equitable access to COVID

NH


d
 
vac
cination of the following groups under Phase 1a: 
High
-
risk workers in health care facilities
, f
irst 
responders
, and o
lder adults in residential care settings
. Later phases are outlined in this plan.
 
 
SECTION 4: CRITICAL POPULATIONS
:
 
Some populations have b
een disproportionately impacted by 
COVID
-
19 and are at increased risk for infection, severe illness, and death. Data 
has been
 
gathe
red 
from multiple sources to determine accurate numbers for distribution planning. 
Key partnerships 
have been developed with 
organizations that serve vulnerable populations to ensure availability of 
vaccine in these critical populations
 

has 
developed a
 
comprehensive communication plan that clearly delineates methods for 
commu
nication with various entities, including the general public and partners that serve critical 
populations
 
as well as community leaders
.
 
 
SECTION 5: COVID
-
19 PROVIDER RECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT
:
 
NH is a universal
 
childhood
 
vaccine purchase state,
 
with many 
providers 
already
 
enrolled in 
NHIP
. 
A Government/Non
-
government partnership of distribution 
has been
 
implemented. 
Providers identified as vaccinators 
in the first phase 
were
 
prioritized for enrollment. Recruitment 
is being
 
based on utilization in the 
next 
phases, as well as creating depth of vaccine providers and decreasing
 
barriers towards 
immunization.
 
Additi
onally, fixed sites 
on the government side of the response 
were
 
established to 
supplement
 
these individual vaccine providers. Pharmacies 
are also
 
rec
ruited to provide additional 
vaccination services.
 
Vaccine providers 
are
 
verified through the established, Vaccine Provider 
Agreement process
; p
rovider enrollment data 
are
 

(VTrckS) and sent to CDC. Ensuring equit
able access to COVID
-
19 vaccine is central to planning 
efforts, with oversight by the Vaccine Allocation Strategy Branch, and solicitation of feedback from 
the State 
Disaster
 
Medical Advisory Committee
 
and
 
the DHHS Office of Health Equity. Key 
documents le
veraged for this work include

19 VACCINATION PREPAREDNESS PLANNING
 
A.
 
Vaccin
e Planning Process
 
Public health and healthcare organizations in New Hampshire have
 
been planning for 
pandemic 
vaccine distribution for 
nearly
 
two decades. 
There are
 
a number of plans in place to support 
vaccination during a pandemic. We also have the expe
rience of distributing vaccine during the H1N1 
pandemic
 
and other public health emergencies
. 
NH DHHS
 
has 
leverage
d
 
these plans
, our existing 
strong partnerships,
 
and our 
prior 
experience 
in order 
to 
mount a comprehensive vaccination 
program in response to 
COVID
-
19.
 
For COVID
-
19 specifically, 
NH DHHS has been planning 
since June
 
2020 
for the eventual availability of a safe and effective COVID
-
19 vaccine.
 
This planning
 
has been
 
accomplished through formation of a structured planning team with feedback from pa
rtners.
 
B.
 
Continuous Quality Improvement
 
Maintaining a flexible approach and willingness to adapt vaccination initiative strategies throughout 
the response 
is
 
important to problem solving and ensuring an effective program. 
Continuous quality 
improvement is c
onducted through established strategic planning, participation in roundtables, 
preparedness exercises, including annual school
-
based flu vaccine clinics and after
-
action meetings, 
and regular engagement with internal and external partners. This approach wi
ll continue 
throughout the COVID
-
19 response efforts, following traditi
onal incident command s
tructure. The 
following 
historical 
events have 
also 
contributed 
to the overall planning process:
 

 
Key findings from the 2009 Influenza A H1N1 
pandemic vaccination 
initiative
 

 
Key findings from the 2019 Crimson Contagion  high
-
threat infectious disease national exercise

formed to provide input on the equitable 
distribution of durable medical equipment, medications and other scarce med
ical resources during 
the COVID
-
19 pandemic. This expanded i
nto the development of the State 
Disaster Medical Advisory 
Committee
 
(SDMAC) group, and has assumed advisory capacity for COVID
-

cation 
related response efforts 
(
Appendix 4
)
. 
 
E.
 
Local Coordination
 
 
New Hampshire
 
has
 
a centralized public health structure with 
disease control authority resting with 

Manchester and Nashua. In order to provide local public health response capacity
, there are 
13 
R
egional Public Health Networks
 
(
RPHNs), that plan
, train
 
for, and respond
 
to public health 
emergencies based on 
CDC

. 
Their role is to improve
 
the overall 
preparedness and res
iliency of communities, while also developing specific emergency response 
capabilities across the public health, health care, and behavioral health systems
, which includes 
extensive planning and exercising for mass vaccination initiatives
.
 
During COVID
-
19 
response efforts, 
the RPHNs
 
are
 
conduct
ing
 
COVID
-
19 vaccination clinics within their regions. Their response effort 
participation 
is
 
coordinated through the state ICS structure.
 
The RPHNs have plans in place to 
communicate with key stakeholders and local o
fficials within their regions and with the State of New 
Hampshire during emergency response and mass vaccination campaigns.

ereby vaccine may be available as follows: 
 
Phase 1: Potentially Limited Doses Available
 
Phase 2: Large Number of Doses Available, Supply Likely to Meet Demand
 
Phase 3: Likely Sufficient Supply, Slowing Demand
 
A Vaccine Allocation Strategy Branch was devel
oped to inform strategies related to equitable 
dose distribution. This branch coordinates with the aforementioned SDMAC group for external 
perspective and recommendations. The final approval of vaccine distribution 
is
 
informed by 
recommendations from the C

in New Hampshire, which include: 
 

 
Maximum benefit encompasses the obligation to
 

and its socioeconomic well
-
being in the short and long term. 
 

 
Equal concern requires that every person be considered and treated as having equal dignity, 
worth, and value. 
 

 
Mitigation of health inequities includes t
he obligation to explicitly address the higher burden 
of COVID
-
19 experienced by the populations affected most heavily, given their exposure and 
compounding health inequities. 
 
 
Additionally, we adopted the

Fairness requires engagement with the public, particularly those most affected by the 
pandemic, and impartial dec
ision making about and evenhanded application of allocation 
criteria and priority categories. 
 

 
Transparency includes the obligation to communicate with the public openly, clearly, 
accurately, and straightforwardly about the allocation framework as it is be
ing developed, 
deployed, and modified. 
 

 
Evidence

M
arginalized groups have been 
disproportionately
 
impacted by COVID
-
19
, including
 
widening gaps in health access and health 
outcomes related to COVID
-
19, as evidenced in our epidemiologic data. Current epidemiologic 
evidence
 
shows that nationally
,
 
COVID
-
19 disproportionately affects marginalized racial and ethnic 
groups including Black, Hispanic or Latinx, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian 
and Paci
fic Islander communities. 
I
ncreased risk of COVID
-
19 in these communities and others 
may 
be
 
tied to social risk that are a direct result of historical systemic inequities (e.g., disproportionate 
representation in high
-
risk jobs in essential industries). Ad
vanced age, specific comorbid conditions, 
and other factors also put individuals and communities at higher risk for severe COVID
-
19 morbidity 
and mortality.
 
The expected allocation of vaccines to these populations is outlined in 
our allocation

Critical population groups 
at increased risk of hospitalization and death 
may include:
 

 
Healthcare personnel

of COVID 19 metrics by age, race, ethnici
ty and gender. As of November 10, 2020, racial and ethnic 
minorities in New Hampshire 
experienced
 
2.8 times the rate of COVID

19 infection, 4.4 times the 
rate of hospitalization and 1.5 times the mortality rate compared to white NH residents, after 
adjusti

The 
CCVI
 
identifies communities within the context of the COVID
-
19 pandemic
 
that may be
 
more vulnerable than others 
due to
 
limited ability to mitigate, treat, and delay transmission of a 
pandemic disease, and to reduce 
its economic and social impacts
.
 
It combines indicators specific to 
COVID
-
19 with the CDC social vulnerability index (
SVI
), which measures the expected negative 
impact of disasters of any type. The CCVI is not design
ed to predict which individuals will become 
infected with coronavirus 

 
instead, it tells us about the anticipated negative impact at the 
community level. This helps decision
-
makers target resour
ces where they are most needed.
 
 
 
In order to mitigate inequi
ties in health care access and health outcomes, NH 
is
 
identify
ing 
and prioritizing
 
populations that are at a high risk of experiencing health disparities tied to race and 
ethnicity. Based on NASEM recommendations, NH will withhold 10% of the available vacc
ine supply 
at the state level for deployment in areas disproportionately impacted by COVID
-
19
.
 
Areas 
disproportionately impacted by COVID
-
19 
are
 
identified through the 
CCVI
. 
The vaccine reserve 
is 
distributed to census tracts indicated as areas of high vul
n
erability according to the CCVI
. Among 
these census tracts of high vulnerability (defined as the top 25 percent of the CCVI distribution 
within the state) vaccine 
is
 
distributed proportionally according to populat
ion. Education efforts for 
vaccine distrib
ution will advocate for those who are highest risk within these census tracts to self
-
select to be vaccinated first so that highest risk individuals receive vaccine first.

phase of the initiative. As a uni
versal state for childhood vaccines, New Hampshire already has many 
providers enrolled in the immunization program. Enrollment will need to be significantly expanded, 
and will be driven based on the phased vaccine allocation strategy.

This enables the public side, for 
those that are unable to have medical direction or skilled personnel, to adminis

CITY
 
A.
 
Estimated Vaccine Administration Capacity
 
Capacity plans 
were
 
expanded from previous pod exercise experience
 
and plans
. Specifically, school
-
based flu vaccine clinics, recent Hepatitis A vaccine clinics and H1N1 vaccine clinics. Efforts to expand 
capa
city focus on a model of approximately 25
-
30% of administered vaccine being distributed 
through the thirteen 
RPHNs
, either through RPHN
-
run clinics or through the state
-
run fixed sites
. 
The RPHNs will 
operate
 
one mobile 
team
 
in each region
. 
A workforce bra
nch is activated within the 
Vaccine Operations Section
 
to coordinate state
-
wide volunteers. Additional efforts to expand 
capacity include leveraging Emergency Medical Services, a centralized system in New Hampshire, 
local National Guard, and working with p
rofessional medical, nursing, and pharmacy licensing 
boards and schools to provide vaccinators. This 
is being
 
built off the foundation of the Medical 
Reserve Corp.  
 
B.
 
Provider Recruitment Plans
 
The recruitment plan for vaccinators 
is
 
informed by the Vaccine
 

recommendations on phases of vaccine implementation. It is generally recognized that the 
greatest 
amount of vaccine providers will be utilized in Phases 2 and forward. The goal is to create vaccine 
through
-
put of approxi
mately 100 vaccinations per hour at each of the thirteen fixed locations, while 
simultaneously providing mobile vaccination clinics to smaller, vulnerable populations that may 
have more difficulty accessing fixed sites.
 
 
On December 22, 2021, a health aler
t network 
message
 
was issued that provided 
instructions to healthcare organizations for how to enroll as a COVID
-
19 Vaccine Provider. These 
instructions are also avail
able 
online
. 
Agreements submitted 
are
 
reviewed and placed in a queue 
based on the demographics/risk groups
 
that the provider organization serves and relevance to the 
cur
rent phase of vaccine distribution. Training
 
requirements and information 
are
 
communicated 
after the agreement is received and reviewed prior
 
to vaccine distribution.
 
Note that NH DHHS 
can 
only provide
 
vaccine to these entities when vaccine supply allows.

goal is to vaccinate one 
phase of the p
opulation throughout the state prior to proceeding with 
vaccination of the next phase
, however, it is understood that due to differences in vaccine uptake 
in different populations it is more likely that the phases will have overlap as we continue to make 
v

. 


an has assured availability of a 
s
econd 
dose of the 
same vaccine presentation for 
persons provided their first dose
. 
 
B.
 
Cold Chain Capability
  
 
The different vaccine formulations have various vaccine storage and handling requirements. New 
Hampshire ensure
s
 
that all providers receiving vaccine understand the requirements and have the 
appropriate equipment to ensure proper
 
storage of vaccine. As
 
final storage and handling 
requirements are released
 
for each vaccine formulation
, 
New Hampshire will determine
 
if 
additional 
strategies 
are needed
 
to provide adequate freezer and deep freezer vaccine storage. Federal 
supplemental f
unding has allowed for the purchase of thirteen refrigerators and fourteen freezers. 
Further funding 
can
 
be leveraged to assist in purchasing additional equipment
 
if needed
. 
Additional 
state capacity includes five refrigerators and one freezer. Federal sup
plemental funding has allowed 
for the purchase of a pharmacy
-
grade freezer, one ultra
-
cold freezer, and forty
-
two portable 
refrigerators/freezers (can be used in either capacity). Building upon the knowledge gained as a 
Universal Vaccine Purchase state, cu
rrent capacities are measured and reported for the majority of 
pediatric and family practice clinics. The capacity among these clinics is currently stronger in 
refrigeration vs freezing capability.

A.
 
Monitoring Ad
herence to Vaccine Storage and Handling Requirements
 
As a Universal Vaccine Purchase state, a large number of our Family Practice providers are enrolled 
with the NHIP. On an annual basis, these practices receive vaccine management training and 
education. P
rior to the receipt of COVID
-
19 vaccine, new vaccine providers 
are
 
required to complete 
vaccine storage and handling training. This training 
i
nclude
s
 
mobile clinic vaccine management, in 
addition to other clinical operation instruction (PPE, COVID
-
19 scree
ning, drive through clinic 
considerations and documentation). The training 
is
 
conducted via an independent, on

ECTION 9: VACCINE ADMINISTRATION DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
 
A.
 
Vaccine D
oses Administered Data Collection
 

was
 
used to collect data on vaccine doses 
administered. 
 
In 
future
 
phases, NH DHHS will 
implement the
 
Vaccine
 
and Immunization Network 
Interface (VINI) system
, developed by NH
 
DHHS
 
through a vendor

patient scheduling and documentation software or an Electronic Health Record (HER). If a provider 
prefers to use their EHR, then they are required to send a flat file to NHIIS daily to report 
administe
red doses.
 
Final vaccine administration data 
will reside
 
in the
 
NH
IIS.
 
The CDC and FDA currently require states to collect certain information for every person who 
receives a COVID
-
19 vaccine
.
 
The CDC and FDA have stated two primary reasons for these 
requi
rements. First, 
some of 
the COVID
-
19 vaccines require two doses, so states need to keep track 
of individuals receiving vaccinations to ensure each person that receives an initial dose receives the 
second dose of the same va
ccine on the proper timeline. 
The
 
second reason is that these vaccines 
have been approved through an emergency use authorization (EUA). This
 
is an unprecedented 
situation because these are the first vaccines approved through an EUA that are also being
 
d
istributed nationwide for a mass vac
cination. States are therefore being required to keep track of 
who is getting
 
each vaccine to monitor vaccine safety and efficacy. 
To 
bring the State into 
compl
iance with Federal requirements, o
n December 11, 2020, Governor Christopher T. Sununu 
issued 
Emergency Order #76
, which requires 
that all patient level information relating to COVID
-
19 
vaccine administration be stored in the NHIIS. The order als

right to opt
-
out or withdraw from NHIIS, for COVID
-
19 vaccine information only. 
New Hampshire 
designed its order narrowly to come into compliance with Federal requirements while ensuring that 
immunization information 
is kept confidential and stored securely. 
This order pertains only to 

-
19
 
vaccination
.
 
NH DHHS has issued 
FAQs
 
for the public regarding the 
NH
IIS and data privacy.
 
B.
 
Submission 
of 
Vaccine Administration Data to
 
the Immunization (IZ) Gateway. 
 
The 
IZ Gateway
 
is a federal mechanism for connecting IISs or other documentation systems to 
CDC 
to share 
authorized
 
vaccination information
. 
Currently, N
ew 
H
ampshire
 
is scheduled in the fifth 
phase of an IZ Gateway c
onnection. 
In the event the IZ Gateway cannot be utilized to provide data 
to federal partners, N
ew 
H
ampshire
 
will use a manual data upload for reporting purposes
.

law in a timely fashion. NHIP will follow up with vaccine providers that do not adhere to vaccine 
d
ocumentation and 
reporting requirements.
 
For 
later phases
, 
VINI 
will be used 
for providers who 

lat file to NHIIS. If a provider is able to generate a flat file and upload it in NHIIS, 
they

rs towards immunization. This 
i
s
 
achieved by reviewing

t into sub categories: RPHNs, external health care 
provider entities/organizations
,
 
national, corporate vaccine providers, contracted through the CDC, 
and the general public
.
 
Reception of partner communication messages will be monitored through 
bidirection
al communication with stakeholder groups. Reception of public communication 
messages will be monitored through the
 
joint information center, the NH DHHS
 
public information 
office, media inquiries, and social media monitoring.

 Section 1: 
COVID
-9 Vaccination Preparedness Planning
 Describe 
you
r early 
COVID
-19 vaccination program planning activities
, including
 lessons learned 
and improvements made 
from 
the 2009 
H1N1 
vaccination campaign
, seasonal influenza campaigns,
 and other 
responses
 to identify gaps in preparedness
.  The Immunization Program Manager, working 
with the 
State
 Epidemiologist 
and
 the Deputy Commissioner of 
Health
 identified the need to bring together a
 COVID
-19 Vaccine Planning Team with representation from 
state government including 
mul
tiple divisions in the
 Vermont Department of
 Health 
(VDH)
, 
the 
Agency of 
Digital Servi
ces
 (ADS)
 and 
Vermont Emergency Management
 (VEM)
.  There was also representation from 
the 
University of Vermont Medical Center
 Infectious Disease
 and the
 Vaccine Testing Center
.  The initial goals of 
the COVID
-19 Planning 
Team w
ere
 to:
  
1. Expand current systems to ensure statewide access to 
COVID
-19 vacci
ne.
 Vaccine will be provided to 
priority groups through mass vaccination clinics initially, and then the public through routine 
immunization services.
  
2. Create a system to monitor the allocation, distribution, 
administration,
 and ongoing evaluation of 
COVID
-19 vaccine statewide.
  
3. Expand access to pediatric and adult 
influ
enza
 vaccine in Fall
/Winter
 2020 to limit morbidity and 
mortality due to flu and additional stress on the health care system.
 Utilize school
-located vaccine 
clinics (SLVC™s) for outreach to those <19 years and targeted community clinics for high
-risk adults.
 4. Develop a comprehensive communication plan to promote the uptake of flu and C
OVID
-19 vaccines, 
with specific outreach to vulnerable populations. 
 5. Use the Homeland Security Exercise and Ev
aluation Program for continuous program evaluation and 
improvement.
  The Team began 
twice 
monthly
 meeting
s on July 9, 2020
. 
The committee has three subgroups formed to 
address the wide range of planning needs. These groups are active and meeting 
weekly to plan for an effective 
COVID
-19 vaccination campaign.
 Subgroups
  IT/Data/Immunization Registry
  Logistics
  Communications
 The primary lesson learned from the H1N1 flu vaccination effort in 2009 was
 to manage Vermonters™ 
expectations for vaccine availability, and offer clear, frequent, and forthcoming information using tested Crisis 
and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) principles
. 
Many 
other 
lessons on communications were also 
noted and 
are being integrated into planning.
 There were delays in enteri
ng vaccines administered into the 
Vermont
 Immunization Registry
 (VT IIS)
. 
Many 
of
 these
 issues have been resolved
. Work is 
continuing to 
ensure 
that 
all COVID
-19 
vaccines administered are reported 
within 24 hours, per guidance
 from the Centers 
for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC)
.

  Continue to refine the critical populations definition 
Œ 
Vermont COVID
-19 Vaccine Advisory 
Committee reviews allocation proposal
  When 
COVID
-19 v
accine 
becomes
 available:
  Distribute initial vaccine allocation to address those identified in Phase 1A; utilize closed/open POD™s 

for mass vaccination approach (CDC)
  Offer open mass va
ccination
 clinics through VDH for those that can™t be reach
ed through hospitals, 
pharmacies,
 or closed POD™s 
  Utilize the Immunization Registry and CDC 
Vaccine Administration Management software to monitor 

vaccination uptake and conduct reminder recall for 
second 
dose, if indicated
  When vaccine allocation increas
es  Expand vaccine availability by allocating doses to enrolled PCP™s 
  
Include the number/dates of and qualitative information on planned workshops or tabletop, functional, or full
-scale exercises that will be held prior to COVID
-19 vaccine availability. Explain how continuous quality 
improvement occurs/will occur during the exercises and implementation of the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program.
 The Vermont Department of Health employs the Homeland Security Exercise
 and 
Evaluation Program
 (HSEEP)
 to validate plan
s. 
The 
HSEEP 
program 
includes
 a progressive exercise approach and 
a continuous quality 
improvem
ent process.
 The Vermont Department of Health employs the Homeland Security Exercise and

 Se
ction 2: COVID
-19 Organizational Structure and Partner Involvement
 A. Describe your organizational structure.
 The VDH is a centralized public health organization that operates as the only governmental public health 
organization in the State of Vermont.
  
VDH is in the State™s Agency of Human Services. VDH includes the Division of Health Surveillance, where 

both the Public Healt
h Statistics Section 
(i
ncludes the Immunization Registry) 
and Infectious Disease 
Section 
(includ
es the Immunization Program) are located.
 The Immunization Program Manager reports to 
the State Infectious Disease Epidemiologist
 and
 the Registry Manager repor
ts to the Health Statistics 
Director. 
 The Health Operations Center (HOC) is used by the health department to coordinate a local response to 

any major emergency or disaster situation.
  
VDH has statutory authority for all citizens and regions.
  
The 
VDH HOC
 has been fully activated since early March. The HOC connects directly with 12 Local Health 
Office Emergency Operations Centers and the State Emergency Operations Committee (SEOC) using an 

online incident management system and a Voice Over Internet Provider.  Redundant and interoperable 

forms of communication are also maintained if these systems were to fail.    
 VDH works collaboratively with the SEOC and the Joint Information Center when activated. 
The SEOC acts 

as a Multi
-Agency Coordination Center within
 the State Multi
-Agency Coordination System and is 
responsible for coordinating and assigning agency responses in a multi
-agency or multi
-jurisdictional 
environment through pre
-identified State Support Functions (SSF). 
 VDH leads the
 Health and Medical 
Ser
vices Partner Desk and Supports the Agency of Human Services in their lead in the Mass Care, 
Emergency Assistance, Housing and Human Services Partner Desk. 
  B. Describe how your jurisdiction will plan for, develop, and assemble a broader committee of key internal 
leaders and external partners to assist with implementing the program, reaching critical populations, and 

developing crisis and risk communication messa
ging. 
 Vermont is a small state, where the medical and public health communities have close ties and collaborate 
on all important health issues. To ensure timely input from key partners in the state, a 
COVID
-19 Vaccine 
Implementation 
Advisory 
Committee is being
 f
ormed
 which will include wide representation from the 
Crisis Standards of Care Group
 and those w
ho serve populations at greatest risk for COVID
-19. 
See 
appendix C for list of Vermont™s COVID
-19 Vaccine Implementation Advisory Committee members. 
  C. Describe 
how your jurisdiction will plan for, develop, and assemble an internal COVID
-19 Vaccination 
Program planning and coordination team that includes persons with a wide array of expertise as well as 

backup representatives to ensure coverage. 
 As noted in Secti
on 1A, the COVID
-19 Vaccine Planning Team was convened in July 2020.
 The
 Team 
includes 
professionals 
in the areas of 
epidemiolog
y, statistics, 
communications, infectious disease
, IT, 
preparedness,
 and logistics
. The importance of having 
back
-up representat
ion 
is well understood and 
integrated into planning at every level
.     8 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 *Update
d* 
In order to
 coordinate multiple complex components further organization was required.  The following 
highlights the COVID
-19 
vaccine rollout organization that reports to the Health Operations Vaccination 
Branch. 
   See Appendix B for list of COVID
-19 Vaccine Planning Team Members. 
 See Appendix C for list of COVID
-19 Vaccine Implementation Advisory Committee members. 
   D. Describe 
how your jurisdiction will
 coordinate efforts
 between state
, 
local
, and territorial
 authorities
. As noted, the VDH is a 
centralized public health organization.
 The Office of Local Health 
(OLH) 
is one of six 
VDH 
divisions.
 The 
OLH Central Office
 provides administrative management and oversight of the work of 
12 Local Health Offices
 that serve populations that range from about 25,000 to 163,00
0. The leaders for 
each of the 12 Local Health Offices participate in monthly expanded team meetings and are actively 
involved in the work of the currently activated Health Operations
 C
enter
. 
In addition, the State Emergency 
Operations Center coordinates all other state level assistance to be provided during this effort including 
logistical needs such as transport, security, storage, procurement, personnel to support the work of the 
  9 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 Health Department, and are a direct link to the Emergency Management Directors in each city/town.  
Emergency man
agers in each town will have input into plan
ning
. 
 E. Describe how your jurisdiction will engage and coordinate efforts with leadership from tribal communities, 
tribal health organizations, and urban Indian organizations.
 The Abenaki were only recognized as a tribe by Vermont state government in 2011.
 Four Abenaki tribes in 
Vermont are recognized by
 state government:
 Elnu
, Missisquoi,
 Koasek
 and 
Nulhegan
. No
 Vermont tribe 
has federal recognition.
  The Health Equity and Community Engagement Team is exploring ways to leverage emergency response 

funding
 to 
provide
 community
-based initiatives that support indigenous Vermonters and communities 
impacted by the pandemic.
  
*Update
d*
 Vermont is taking steps to build a relationship with Abenaki leaders with the ultimate goal focused on 

better outcomes for First Nations Ve
rmonters. The focus is on safely meeting essential needs during the 

COVID
-19 pandemic. Vermont will be utilizing COVID relief and chronic
 disease
 prevention funding as an 
avenue to impact change in these communities, while building a substantial relationship that promotes 
trust in a COVID
-19 vaccine.  
A 
member of the Abenaki community join
ed the CO
VID-
19 Vaccine 
Implementation Advisory Committee. 
 Outreach was conducted to determine estimates of tribal members in Vermont as part of state
-recognized 
tribes. The Abenaki are the western
-most group of the Wabanaki Federation.

 Pharmacies
 Œ 
The Immunization Program has a strong 
working relationship with the Executive Director 
of the Board of Pharmacy and the Pharmacy Director for the Department of Vermont Health Access
 (DVHA);
 both 
are active members of the Immunization Funding Advisory Committee. 
DVHA is 
responsible for administ
ering the Vermont Medicaid health insurance program and Vermont's state
-based exchange for health insurance. 
VDH, in collaboration with Vermont Information Technology 
Leaders (VITL), is actively working with 
all pharmacies
 to support efforts to report vacc
ines 
administered within 24 hours.
  Community
-based facilities
 Œ 
Community
-based organizations will be essential in reaching 
those
 65 years
 and older. 
VDH is collaborating with 
the Department of 
Disabilities, 
Aging and Independent 
Living 
(DAIL) in planning
 to ensure COVID
-19 vaccination services will be accessible to those living in 
assisted living facilities
, 
senior 
residences,
 and 
the community.
  
In addition to DAIL and other key State 
partners, we will coordinate closely with organizations that serve people who are disproportionately 

affected by COVID
-19 to understand and address potential barriers to vaccine accessibility and update. 
Through the COVID
-19 response to date, our Health Equity and Community Engagement (HECE) team 
has grown existing relations
hips with community partners and established new connections to 
organizations that do this important work. Ensuring that all Vermonters have access to both 

transparent information about a vaccine, and the vaccine itself, is critical.
  Correctional facilities
 - 
In Vermont, the Department of Corrections
 (DOC)
 and the Health Department 
are 
housed within the Agency of Human Services.
 In the past year, the Immunization Program worked 
closely with the D
OC and their vendor for healthcare services to provide and administer hepatitis A 
vaccine as part of outbreak prevention efforts. During the COVID
-19 pandemic, testing has been 
routinely provided in correctional facilities by Health Department staff.
 Due to additional federal 
funding, the Immuni
zation Program
 was able to 
provide 
the DOC 
flu vaccine
 this year for use 
inmates
 and staff
. 
 
VDH 
is actively working with the 
DOC to enhance 
immunization reporting
, to ensure they will be 
eligible for enrollment in the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program.
  
 Homel
ess Shelters
 - 
Extensive work has been done to address the needs of
 people experiencing 
homeless
ness during the pandemic.
 O
utreach 
to ensure access to testing for people experiencing 
homelessness has been successful. We also have a successful history of ou
treach to facilities that 
provide services to this population for other vaccination efforts, including H1N1 and hepatitis A. We 

will build on these experiences and modify this model, working with key community partners as 

needed, to ensure access to testin
g for this population.
  State Emergency Operations Center

 Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID
-19 Vaccination
 A. Describe how your jurisdiction will structure 
the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program
 around the 
four
 phases of 
vaccine administration
: 
Phase 1: 
Potentially
 Limited 
Doses 
Av
ailable
 Phase 2: Large 
Number of 
Doses 
Available, 
Supply 
Likely to 
Meet 
Demand
 Phase 3: Likely 
Suff
icient
 Supply
, Slowing Demand
 Phase 4: More Supply than Demand
         
Phase 1A and B
:   To reach 
those populations identified in 1A and 1B
, mass 
vaccination clinics will be provided across the 
state
 through a variety of vaccine clinic models.
 These populations are contingent on ACIP 
recommendations. 
The current plan under development will:
  Determine the number in each designated critical population
    Enroll all health care facilities or organizations that will receive/administer COVID
-19 vaccine as a 
COVID
-19 Vaccination Provider. 
  Facilities/organizations that enroll in the program and can vaccinate health care workers 
(hospitals) 
will be asked to 
conduct clinics.
  Facilities/organizations that have signed a Memorandum of Agreement to provide vaccination 
services to a
n identified ﬁcriticalﬂ
 population and meet all requirements will provide vaccine 
through a closed Point of Distribution (POD)
 will be utilized to reach critical populations.
  
 Based on 
current
 CDC guidance, residents and staff 
of 
long
-term care facilities (LTCF™s)
 will be 
vaccinated by one of 
three
 national chain pharmacies that CDC contract
ed with. 
Further details 
are expected soon.
  VDH will determine the need for mass vaccination clinics (Open PODs) to address any gaps or 

regional needs.  Open POD
 locations
 that have been previously designated will
 be used as 
allocation to provide these services
.    GIS mapping will be utilized to det
ermine coverage and access needs
  VDH will w
ork with the pharmacies, EMS providers,

 vaccine administration efforts 
       *Update
d* Pha
se 1A:
 Pharmacy 
Partnership for Long
-term Care (LTC) Program:
 Vermont plans to participate in the pharmacy partnership for Long
-term Care Program coordinated by 
CDC.
 100% of Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) enrolled in the CDC Pharmacy Partnership, as did 100% of 
assiste
d living facilities, residential care and
 17 therapeutic homes. It is anticipated that based on current 
enrollment, one
-third would utilize CVS, one
-third Walgreens, and one
-third Health Direct.
 Health Direct is 
a sister company to Kinney Drugs and have be
en administering flu vaccines in LTCFs for years. Their 
current infrastructure will be utilized as an asset for administering COVID
-19 vaccine. 
 Letters were sent to all pharmacies informing them of federal partnerships and extending a state 
enrollment opt
ion for those not currently confirmed as utilizing the federal partnership option. A second 
correspondence w
as sent
 to pharmacies™ eligible for enrollment at the state level (estimated 
35 pharmacies). Messaging reminded these groups that if a pharmacy or their parent company are in the 
process of enrolling in the federal program, then they should not enroll with the state program.

  Version 2.0
  Partner through CDC™s Pharmacy Partnership for LTC Program for COVID
-19 Vaccine to provide on
-site vaccine clinics for resident
s and staff 
of long
-term care facilities (LTCFs) provides end
-to-end
 management
 of the COVID
-19 vaccination process, including close coordination with 
jurisdictions, cold chain management, on
-site vaccinations, and fulfillment of reporting 
requirements. Th
e program will facilitate safe and
 effective vaccination of this prioritized patient 
population, while reducing burden on facilities and jurisdictional health departments. 
 o This program is free of charge to facilities. The pharmacy will:  
  Schedule and coo
rdinate on
-site clinic date(s) directly with each facility.
 Three visits 
over approximately two months are likely to be needed to administer both doses 
of vaccine and vaccinate any new residents and staff. 
  Order vaccines and associated supplies (e.g., sy
ringes, needles, personal protective 
equipment)
.  Ensure cold chain management for vaccine. 
  Provide on
-site administration of vaccine.
  Report required vaccination data (approximately 20 data fields) to the local, 

state/territorial, and federal jurisdictions within 24 hours of administering each 

dose.
  Adhere to all applicable CMS requirements for COVID
-19 testing for LTCF staff.
  Each facility was required to
 sign up and indicate their preferred partner from the available pharmacies.
 Enrollment is now closed.
  CDC expects the Pharmacy Partnership for Long
-term Care Program services
 to continue on
-site at 
participating facilities for approximately
 two months.
    After the initial phase of vaccinations, the facility can choose to continue working with the 

pharmacy that provided its initial on
-site clinics or can choose to work with a pharmacy provider 
of its choice.
 Phase 1B: The ACIP has 
identified
 which groups it
 will recommend for Phase 1B. The Vermont COVID
-19 
Vaccine Advisory Committee is meeting weekly to review data and discuss 
which groups would be include
d 
in 
Phase 1B. 
 Phase 2: Large number of doses available, focus is on increasing access to vaccine for an extended 
population
 *Update
d* Federal Direct Allocation to Pharmacy Partners:
 Vermont plans to participate in the federal direct allocation to pharmacy partner strategy coordinated by CDC. 
  Vaccine will be allocated and distributed directly to select pharmacy partners from the federal 
government.
 o Direct allocation opportunities will be provided to retail chain pharmacies and networks of 
independent and community pharmacies
2 (those with a minimum of 200 stores). All 
partners must sign a pharm
acy provider agreement with the federal government. 
 o Once the list of federal partners has been finalized, CDC will share the list with 

jurisdictions. 
  2Pharmacy services administrative organizations, or PSAOs
  
  14 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 o On a daily basis, pharmacy partners must report to CDC, the number of doses of COVID
-19 
vaccine a) order
ed by store location; b) supply on hand in each store reported through 
VaccineFinder, and c) number of doses of vaccine administered to individuals in each 
state, locality, and territory. 
  Pharmacy providers will be required to report CDC
-defined data elements related to vaccine 
administration daily (i.e., every 24 hours). CDC will provide information on these data elements 
and methods to report if stores are not able to directly provide data to jurisdiction IISs.  
  All jurisdictions participating in this program will have visibility on number of doses distributed to 
and administered by each partner store.
  Jurisdictions will be given contact information for each partner participating in this program if they 

have any questions or concer
ns related to distribution of vaccine to stores in their jurisdiction. 
 Medical Home System
: 
In Phase 2, 
access 
will be expanded 
to 
provide 
COVID
-19 vaccination fully utilizing 
Vermont™s 
strong medical home system.
 The current s
ystem
 used by the Vermont Va
ccination Program to 
provide over $16 million in vaccines annually to primary care providers, will
 be used to supply
 COVID
-19 
vaccination.  
  A
ctivities offered in Phase 1 
will be re
-assessed to determine if there is a need for continuation 
or 
modification of open or closed pods
. Access may be expanded to specific population groups, depending on 
risk 
factors, public 
demand,
 and access 
to vaccine clinics
. 
The Medical Reserve Corp
s (MRC)
 will be utilized for staffing support, as needed and availab
le.
 The MRC are 
currently supporting influenza vaccine clinics in some areas of the state, gaining recent experience with 
vaccination clinics
.    Phase 3: 
Sufficient supply 
anticipated, 
in addition to possible slowing demand 
 The primary care medical home 
system and pharmacies will be key players in ensuring access to COVID
-19 
vaccine in Phase 3.  By Phase 3, it is expected that a majority of 
primary care providers 
(PCP
s) currently 
enrolled
 in the Vermont Vaccine Program 
will be 
enrol
led in the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program
, as well as 
providers that 
were previously
 not enrolled 
(hospitals, pharmacies)
. 
Data will be essential in determining vaccination levels among various populations, to plan for targeted 
outreach in Phase 3, if indicated
.  The Vermont Immunization Registry and GIS mapping will be utilized to 

assess COVID
-19 vaccination rates statewide and by county and town. 
 Use of PCP™s to conduct outreach in rural and more urban communities has been effective in expanding access 

to inf
luenza vaccine
 during the 2020
-21 flu season. 
Funding for op
erational support to PCP™s to offer off
-site 
clinics 
has been shown to
 increase access to 
young children and 
school age children
. 
Mass vaccination efforts 
will be limited to special situations
. 
       15 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 *Update
d* Hospitals will be a key partner in providing vaccine to the 1A populations, those identified as highest risk.  
All 
14 hospitals have agreed to vaccinate health care workers (HCW™s) within their hospital service area, in 
addition to their emplo
yees. This will greatly enhance the ability to effectively reach EMS 
and other 
community HCP who provide 
direct
 care. 
Pharmacies are being recruited to become COVID
-19 vaccine 
providers through either the federal or state pharmacy program. 
Additions to the federal pharmacy 
partnerships were updated above based upon 
specifics sent from the CDC. 
Additions to the federal pharmacy 
partnership were updated above based
 Primary care providers (PCP™s), beginning with federally qualified health cente
rs (FQHC™s) are currently being 
enrolled.  COVID
-19 vaccine will likely be allocated to PCP™s in Phase 2, when supplies are adequate.  
    The initial version of the plan 
included a graphic of the National Academies of Science
s, Engineering, and 
Medicine (
NASEM)
™s vaccine phased distribution approach. 
Since the initial drop of this plan, the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)

  Vermont used the CDC Critical Populations list and further 
defined 
the
se groups based on 
available 
state
 data
.  The estimates for each group were gathered from local sources where possible (
i.e.,
 State 
agencies
, including
 the 
Department for Children and Families, D
AIL
, D
OC, 
Agency
 of 
Agriculture,
 and 
others.
 CDC estimates will be used
 when
 local data 
is not available

needs
 and
 barriers
.    To ensure that a variety of historically/statistically underserved populations have opportunities 
to 
voice their beliefs
 and needs related to COVID
-19 vaccination, the Health Equity and Community 
Engagement Team will recommend the following to the Advisory Committee:
  Convene listening sessions with specific priority populations 
  Visit existing coalitions, such as the Multi
-Lingual Taskforce, the Chronic Disease and 
Disability Advisory Group, the Racial Equity Taskforce, to seek recommendations and 

hear feedback about h
ow the COVID

  B. Describe how your jurisdiction will define and estimate numbers of persons 
in the critical infrastructure 
workforce, which will vary by jurisdiction.
  
Vermont is working with Vermont Emergency Management to determine the critical infrastructure 

workforce. 
 Addendum 6 of the State of Vermont Governor™s Executive Order 01
-20 that initially 
described ﬁessential workersﬂ in the State of Vermont during the State of Emergency will also be used 
in determination of the critical infrastructure workforce
. The 
COVID
-19 Vaccine Implementation 
Advisory Committee will also be asked to review the definition and provide feedback.
  C. Describe
 how your jurisdiction will 
determine 
additional
 subset groups of critical population
s if there is
 insufficient vaccine supply
.   The COVID
-19 Vaccine Implementation Advisory Committee will include members from the   Vermont 
Hospital Emergency Preparedness Coalition, Crisis Standards of Care Clinical Advisory Group
, and 
others.  This committee will be asked to provide guidance on cri
tical populations subgroups, if initial 
allocations of vaccine to Vermont are limited. This recommendation will be brought to the 
Commissioner of Health for final review/determination
  D. Describe how your jurisdiction will establish points of contact (POCs)
 and communication methods
 for 
organization
s, employer
s, or communit
ies
 (as appropriate) within the critical population groups.
  VDH conducts outreach to a multitude of partners on a wide variety of public health concerns. Points 
of contact for many of the 
organizations or employers for critical population groups have been 

identified.  There are also many advisory groups and coalitions coordinated through VDH, through 
which outreach can be expanded.  VDH will coordinate efforts with the Agency of Human Servi
ces and 
Vermont Emergency Management. 
 *Update
d* Data obtained for critical populations are outlined above and continue to be refined. Most data are available 
at the local 
level
, such as facility

-level. Phase 1A data sources include numbers reported by 
hospitals, long
-term care facilities
, licensed healthcare workers, and the Vermont EMS office. Most of the data 
for remaining phases are compiled, but some groups continue to be refined to get more precise estimates. For 
example, estimating the number of individuals under 65 who are high
-risk due to chronic disease(s) or 
immunosuppression will be refined by comparing county

  Describe how your jurisdiction will approve planned redistribution of COVID
-19 vaccine (e.g., health 
systems or commercial partners with depots, smaller vaccination providers needing less than the 
minimum order requirement). 
 Health Department Local Health
 Offices (LHO) and the Immunization Prog
ram will serve as 
redistribution centers to accept transfers of excess vaccine, and orders that will be redistributed in 

quantities of less than 100 doses. The LHO will redistribute under the direction of the Program
.       23 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 *Update
d* The State Emergency Operations Committee (SEOC) has developed a comprehensive
 Vermont™s 
Vaccine 
Depot Plan
 that addresses all aspect of distribution of COVID
-19 vaccines
. This plan will serve 
as a supporting document to the Vermont Medical 
Countermeasures plan and this COVID
-19 
vaccination plan. This plan details the process and requirements for bulk receipt, staging, storing, and 
distribution of vaccines 
to Medical Treatme
nt Facilities (MTFs) and Points of Distribution (PODs)
. The 
main objectives of activation of the COVID
-19 Vaccine Depot are summarized as follows:
  To receive bulk COVID
-19 vaccines into Vermont
  To provide inventory control, picking, quality 
control, and staging of COVID
-19 vaccines
  To ensure COVID
-19 vaccine cold chain management during receipt, storage, staging, and 
shipping
  To distribute material to medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and Points of Distribution (PODs)
  To provide communicati
on/IT support between the Vaccine Depot, its delivery staff, and main 
points of control (VDH™s HOC, State EOC, etc.)
  To provide security for Vaccine Depot
 The process for distribution to vaccine providers with Vermont™s Agency of Transportation (AOT) is as
 follows:
 1. AOT arrives at facility and documents time/ temperature on paper temperature log
 2. AOT gives the POC a call to let them know the vaccine has arrived
 3. AOT brings the vaccine carrier as close to cold storage as possible for quick transfer of 
vaccines.
 (Note: Vaccines will be in white boxes, similar to the attached picture. Hospitals 
can keep these white boxes. Hospitals will not get to keep the vaccine carrier or cooler AOT 
delivers in.) 
 4. AOT provides paper temperature log to provider
 5. Provider removes 
their boxes of vaccines from the carrier
 6. AOT confirms that what provider has pulled out is correct (the boxes will be labeled)
 7. Provider also receives boxes of diluent and ancillary kits.
 8. Provider signs chain of custody paperwork
  F. Describe how your jurisdic
tion will ensure there is equitable access to COVID
-19 vaccination services 
throughout all areas within your jurisdiction.
 Vaccine allocation will be based on population data, with attention to critical populations.
 Vaccine 
administration data from the Imm
unization Registry will be closely monitored and reviewed at a 
granular level by county, 
town,
 and health service area.  In addition, the vaccine doses administered 
by enrolled site will also be monitored and redistribution will be required. 
The 
Immunizati
on Program 
is collaborating with the Health Equity and Community Engagement Team to ensure access to 
disadvantaged communities and people of color.
 GIS mapping 
and Social Vulnerability Indices 
will be 
employed to identify areas with limited access and 
direct distribution efforts.
 G. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to recruit and enroll pharmacies not served directly by CDC and 

their role in your COVID
-19 Vaccination Program plans.
  Pharmacies
 that have not contracted
 directly by CDC will be recruited 
to enroll in the Vermont COVID
-19 Vaccination Program by 
e-mail
 with a 
link to the enrollment form
s. Pharmacies must adhere to 
the 
same requirements as any other facility receiving the COVID
-19 vaccine.
 They may be requested to 
  24 Vermont Department of Health

 provide on
-site vaccination 
clinics at 
senior 
residential housing 
sites or 
other
 areas to address access

  This information indicates that it will be essential to 
facilitate enrollment and support efforts to address 
known 
barriers 
(i.e.,
 24-hour reporting
). The enrollment process will need to be closely
 monitored to 
support organizations and practices in completing all steps

 Section 7: COVID
-19 Vaccine Allocation, Ordering, Distribution, and 
Inventory Management
 A. Describe your 
jurisdiction™s plans for allocating/assigning allotments of vaccine throughout the 
jurisdiction using information from Sections 4, 5, and 6. Include allocation methods for populations of 
focus in early and limited supply scenarios as well as the variables 
used to determine allocation.
 VDH
 will collect data to define all 
critical
 populations and sub
-populations. This data gathered will 
determine vaccine allocation with attention to priority groups, including disadvantaged populations. Phase 
1A will focus on 
hospitals and long
-term care facilities, specifically.
 GIS mapping will be employed to 
identify areas with limited access and direct distribution efforts.
 In addi
tion to the National Academies Report on Equitab
le Allocation and the Johns Hopkins Framework
, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for critical populations will be 
reviewed to determine which groups are prioritized for vaccine. Initially, we will work with Vermont™s 

hospitals, pharmacies, and local health offices to
 ensure access to COVID
-19 vaccine in mass vaccination 
settings, as indicated. Advanced EMTs and paramedics will have their scope of practice expanded to 
administer vaccines to eliminate possible barriers for priority populations to receiving vaccine. 
 The
 Immunization Program™s Vaccine Manager has over 20 years of experience and had a lead role in 
H1N1 vaccination ordering and distribution.
 She will lead the team that will place orders and distribute 
vaccine consistent with approved guidance, while factori
ng in variables (storage capacity, clinics planned, 
current inventory). All COVID
-19 vaccine orders will be placed through the Vermont Vaccine Inventory 
Management System
 (VIMS)
 and uploaded to VTrckS. An ADS IT team is currently engaged in VIMS system 
enhancements and awaiting CDC guidance on changes to CDC 
External Information System (
ExIS
) file 
specifications for COVID
-19 vaccine.
  B. Describe your jurisdiction™s plan for assessi
ng the cold chain capability of individual providers and how 
you will incorporate the results of these assessments into your plans for allocating/assigning 
allotments of COVID
-19 vaccine and approving orders.
 The cold chain capability of each site enrolled
 to provide COVID
-19 vaccine will be assessed during the 
enrollment process.
 Each newly enrolled site will be provided continuous temperature monitoring devices 
knowns as ﬁLogTagsﬂ.
 They will be required to submit 3 days of consecutive temperatures in rang
e and a 
picture confirming the placement of the glycol bottle in the center of the refrigerator or freezer.
 For those 
practices who routinely receive vaccine from the Immunization Program and use Wi
-Fi 
cloud
-based
 data 
loggers provided by the Immunization 
Program, the Audit Node report will be 
run,
 and data will be 
reviewed at the practice and by the central office.
 Practices using their own approved monitoring system 
will be required to submit a report showing temperature monitoring and documentation.
 Site
s that are 
unable to show temperatures in range will not receive vaccine until they are able to meet the cold chain 
requirements. Immunization Program staff will work with them to 
adjust
 until the storage units are able to 
hold temperatures in range.
 A tra
cking spreadsheet will be used to track and document the assessment of 
the cold chain capability for each site. Prior to allocation/assigning allotments, that data will be reviewed 
to avoid sending vaccine to a site that cannot maintain required storage co
nditions.
 C.  Describe your jurisdiction™s procedures for ordering COVID
-19 vaccine, including entering/updating 
provider information in VTrckS and any other jurisdictional systems (e.g., IIS) used for provider 
ordering. Describe how you will incorporate the 
allocation process described in step A in provider order 
approval.
   27 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 The Vermont Vaccine Inventory Management System (VIMS) is accessed through the Vermont 
Immunization Registry (
VT-IMR). All users must have an active, individual user account and password. 
Once a provider is enrolled to receive vaccine, this process to set up an account begins. 
 1. The provider must be registered with the Immunization Program and have a PIN assigned 

to a
ccess VIMS.
 a. The original provider file is created in all databases. 
 b.
 If necessary
, for COVID
-19 vaccine, the fund type split template is updated and uploaded 
to VTrckS
 c. Prior to placing a vaccine order in VIMS, providers must verify that their shipping 
info
rmation, hours of delivery and contact information are correct and must notify the 
Program of changes to their information in the editable fields of their request form. 
Changes are then manually updated in databases.
 *Update
d* Initially, due to limited sup
ply
 and the large (975 doses) minimal orders required by Pfizer
, 
the 
COVID
-19 vaccine will be ordered by the jurisdiction on behalf of the receiving provider. 
Orders will be 
entered into VIMS, then processed in VTrckS each afternoon by Immunization Program. This occurs 

after the daily 2:30 pm automated Master Data update. Vaccines redistributed by the Depot will be 
entered into VIMS as a Transfer to the receivin
g provider. 
Initially, this will be limited to 
providers/organizations enrolled as an open or closed PODs and Phase 1 providers.
 Once a regular 
supply of COVID
-19 vaccine is available, the program will allow enrolled providers to place their orders 
via VIM
S. 
All providers will be required to 
reconcile inventory prior to receipt of additional COVID
-19 
vaccine
. This includes number of vaccine available, number of vaccines administered, accounts of 
waste, expirations, and transfers.
 Each
 morning, an extract is run in VTrckS, which is
 uploaded to
 VIMS with information on vaccine 
shipped the previous business day. This is a manual process conducted by the Immunization Program. 
It allows providers to receive updates on when their vaccines ar
e shipped. Providers will also receive 
email communication from the manufacturer or distributor about their shipment and re
-activating 
temperature monitors
 (if applicable)
. All provider transactions entered (adjustment, reconciliation, 
order) in VIMS are r
eviewed and approved by Immunization Program staff.
 2. All COVID
-19 vaccine orders will be reviewed and adjusted as needed during the daily order 
approval process. 
 a. Enhancements are 
planned for
 the VIMS system to capture COVID
-19 vaccine 
allocations. Until th
e enhancements are deployed to production, vaccine allocation 
will be tracked via an Excel spreadsheet.
 b.
 A file extract is initiated every weekday afternoon and uses the External Information 
System (ExIS) interface to upload the transaction data to VTrckS
 c. Immunization Program staff  log into VTrckS and finalize the file uploads.
 VDH will report inventory by calculation to the Vaccine Finder websites on behalf of all enrolled providers 
daily.
 D. Describe how your jurisdiction will coordinate any 
unplanned repositioning (i.e., transfer) of vaccine.
 Vaccine transfers between practices (or Local Health Offices) are approved and monitored by the 
Immunization Program. To this end, the program will ensure that the receiving pr
actice
 ha
s signed and 
  28 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 agree
d to conditions in the 
CDC COVID
-19 Vaccine Redistribution Agreement 
and have a fully completed 
and signed 
CDC COVID
-19 Vaccination Provider Profile 
form. Also, validated cold
-chain procedures must be 
in place in accordance with manufacturer's instructions
 and CDC™s guidance on COVID
-19 vaccine storage 
and handling. The physical transfer will be conducted by the location requesting the vaccine. 
 Vaccine transfers must be entered into the VIMS system by the practice that is providing the vaccine. This 
transa
ction removes doses from their inventory and adds it to the recipients once an Immunization 
Program staff follows up with each practice to ensure the vaccine repositioning has occurred. 
 E. Describe jurisdictional plans for monitoring COVID
-19 vaccine wastage
 and inventory levels.
 The Vaccine Inventory Management System (VIMS) is the platform that assists with managing and 
maintaining vaccine purchases and inventory at participating practices. This system allows the 
Immunization Program to monitor the inventor
y of a practice, as of the last time a provider reconciled. 
Providers will be required to reconcile COVID
-19 vaccine inventory prior to placing a COVID
-19 vaccine 
order.
   Every effort is made to minimize waste, however it can and does happen. Providers must report waste in 
VIMS. Instructions for submitting waste are published on the Vermont Department of Health website and 
providers will be reminded of the procedure. 
 Provi
der training materials are available on the V
DH
 website. The VIMS User Guide will be updated with 
procedures for COVID
-19 vaccine ordering, reconciliation, 
and 
waste. Information on vaccine recovery will 
be shared with providers when made available by CDC.
       29 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 Section 8: COVID
-19 Vaccine Storage and Handling
 A. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to ensure adherence to COVID
-19 vaccine storage and handling 
requirements, including cold and ultracold chain requirements, at all levels: 
  Adherence to the COVID
-19 vaccine storage and handling requirements will be en
sured by having a 
well
-trained staff at each location receiving and administering COVID
-19 vaccine.
 Additionally, on
-site 
staff will review temperature monitoring data daily and the Immunization Program staff will review in 
real
-time for sites that use our
 cloud
-based Wi
-Fi system.
 Sites managing COVID
-19 vaccines will run 
inventory management reports each morning and before each vaccine order to avoid waste and 
ensure the vaccine supply remains viable. Vaccine distribution will be arranged following the 
ve
rification of each provider™s location and ability to meet vaccine storage unit requirements. 
  Ultracold capacity 
for storage of vaccines has been
 assessed by survey
 and potential distribution plans 
will be based on this information.  If 
COVID
-19 vaccine 
requiring ultracold
 storage 
were approved by 
the FDA and recommended by the CDC
, the Immunization Program 
would 
be able to 
order
 it, using 
locations that meet the ultracold 
requirements
.  Sites that have ultracold capacity will need to submit 
temperature monitoring data to the 
Immunization 
Program prior to receiving vaccine.
 Temperature 
monitoring device
s for ultracold vaccine storage units may be provided by the Immunization 
Program.
   Ind
ividual provider locations
 ŒSites currently enrolled use cloud
-based Wi
-Fi data loggers. 
Trained staff on
-site run a temperature monitoring data report twice a day (AM/PM) and 
document the MIN/MAX once a day to confirm temperatures stay in range at all tim
es and 
identify and handle temperature excursions in a timely fashion. Sites using continuous 
monitoring devices without Wi
-Fi capability will download and review data weekly, in addition 
to once daily documentation on the paper temperature log. Each site 
will email a picture of 
the inside of the vaccine storage unit to confirm the glycol bottles proper placement.
 The 
Storage and Handling Quick Guide
 is posted on the Immunization Program website and shared 
with practices after they complete the COVID
-19 enrollment form, but before receiving 
COVID
-19 vaccine.
 Other CDC developed training materials will be used, whe
n available.
  Satellite, temporary, or off
-site settings 
Œ These sites will adhere to the above requirements 
and obtain appropriate transportation equipment
, such as portable units and qualified 
pack 
outs
. The Immunization Program will provide data loggers 
for temperature monitoring at no 
cost to the practice.
 Inventory management is even more critical when taking vaccine off
-site, 
and practices will be advised to only transport the anticipated number of COVID
-19 vaccines 
to be administered.
 Those administer
ing vaccine will monitor and document temperatures on 
hourly temperature logs until the vaccine is used up or back to the permanent storage.
 Temperature monitoring data will be downloaded and reviewed after each clinic is concluded. 

In the case of a temper
ature excursion, the Immunization Program will be contacted, the 
temperature data emailed, and the vaccine assessed for viability.
   Planned redistribution from depots to individual locations and from larger to smaller 
locations
 Œ For planned and 
unplanned redistribution, the same requirements apply as for 
transportation of the vaccine.
 Portable storage units, qualified 
pack outs
 and appropriate 
coolers will be used. The Immunization Program
-provided data logger will monitor the vaccine 
  30 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 until it re
aches the appropriate vaccine storage unit.
 Hourly temperature logs will be used to 
monitor and document the Min/Max temperature every hour.
 Temperature data will be 
downloaded after the vaccine reaches the storage unit. In case of a temperature excursion,
 Immunization Program will need to be contacted.
 The redistribution plan will be 
communicated and coordinated ahead of time with the Immunization Program vaccine 
distribution staff members.
   B. Describe how your jurisdiction will assess provider/redistributi
on depot COVID
-19 vaccine storage and 
temperature monitoring capabilities.
  Before confirming their order of the COVID
-19 vaccine shipment, each site will need to submit 3 
consecutive days of in
-range temperature readings and a picture of the glycol bottle
 placement in the 
storage unit.
 For those using cloud
-based Wi
-Fi data loggers, the Immunization Program will run a 
report to assess temperature readings for the past 3 consecutive days. 
      31 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 Section 9: COVID
-19 Vaccine Administration Documentation and Repo
rting
 A.
 Describe the system your jurisdiction will use to collect COVID
-19 vaccine doses administered data from 
providers.
 Vermont will use a hybrid approach to collecting 
data about 
vaccine doses administered. This includes use 
of 
the CDC 
Vaccine Administration Management System (VA
MS) as well as established reporting systems 
to 
Vermont Immunization Registry (VT
 IIS) that meet CDC data reporting requirements, as outlined in the 
COVID
-19 Provider Agreement.
 Existing systems include entering administration data into an electronic 
health record and sending to the Immunization Registry via HL7 or directly entering these d
ata into the VT 
IIS. 
 All Vermont hospitals except the Veteran™s Administration (VA) currently submit vaccinations via HL7 
messaging. Additionally, three large pharmacy chains utilize HL7, as do most medical providers. We are 

currently engaging with pharma
cies that do not submit via HL7 to onboard with that type of submission 

or, barring that, increase the frequency at which their immunizations are submitted. 
 Provider systems that are unable to meet the CDC data reporting requirements will be offered the V
AMS 
system. 
 The Agency of Digital Services is actively working to implement the CDC 
Web Services Description 
Language (
WSDL
) so that data captured via VAMS can be imported to the VT IIS from the Immunization 
Gateway. 
 *Update
d* A mass 
vaccination VAM
S team was formed to execute all training of VAMS to providers who utilize the 
system to collect and report data of vaccine doses administered. The team have compiled training 
materials from the CDC 
and will utilize the CDC™s VAMS Model Trai
ning Plan and webinar recordings to 
inform VAMS users on the process. A frequently asked questions document will be constructed for easy 
access on the COVID
-19 vaccine section of the Vermont Department of Health website.
 B.
 Describe how your jurisdiction will
 submit COVID
-19 vaccine administration data via the Immunization 
(IZ) Gateway.
 Vermont state law only allows the 
VDH
 to provide Immunization Registry information to the CDC ﬁin 
summary, statistical, or other form in which particular individuals are not id
entified–ﬂ 18 V.S.A. § 1129. An 
alternative approach would be that the Vermont IIS generate and report de
-identified data and submit it 
via secure data transfer (SFTP) as is done with other existing CDC projects that require data submission 

(e.g., the NIS/
IIS CC4 project).
 The Agency of Digital Services
 developed an
 auto
-generated report, which 
would streamline the requirement for daily reporting.
  C.
 Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure each COVID
-19 vaccination provider is ready and able (e.g., 
staff i
s trained, internet connection and equipment are adequate) to report the required COVID
-19 
vaccine administration data elements to the IIS or other external system every 24 hours.
 Vermont™s Immunization Registry has the capacity to enroll new users and the
 Immunization Registry 
program is already actively enrolling users for sites likely to administer COVID
-19 Vaccine in the first phase 
of the response.
    32 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 An established backup phone system with staff triage to provide additional support for new user requests 
will be utilized to assist COVID
-19 vaccination providers as needed. The staff line is currently supported M
-F 7:45am 
Œ 4:30pm. Support request volume 
will be monitored to assess if additional staffing or hours of 
operational support are needed. The Vermont Immunization Registry has numerous tutorials and training 
videos that users may access for support. The support materials are located within the IMR 
application for 
easy access. 
 The VT IIS requires access to the internet and can be used with a personal hotspot (
i.e.,
 an 
iPhone.) In 
locations where cell phone and internet coverage 
are not available, the IMR application is unavailable. To 
date, this has
 not been an issue.
 To connect, one of three browsers must be used: Mozilla Firefox, 
Microsoft Edge, or Internet Explorer.
 *Update
d* All Phase 1A enrolled practices will have the opportunity to attend the webinar series and open office hours to 

learn 
about how to report the required COVID
-19 vaccine administration data elements to the IIS. The webinar 
topics will include:
  Links to forms to gain access based on user type
  Featured IMR tutorials
  Contact information, including a telephone number for passwo
rd resets
  D.
 Describe the steps your jurisdiction will take to ensure real
-time documentation and reporting of 
COVID
-19 vaccine administration data from satellite, temporary, or off
-site clinic settings.
 Vermont law requires all vaccinators in the state to report the immunizations they administer. When 
providers sign the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement, they are agreeing that they will 
adhere to the conditions outlined in the agreement, inc
luding reporting of data regardless of the setting in 
which the vaccination takes place. The Immunization Program will not allow providers to conduct off
-site 
clinics for COVID
-19 if they are unable to meet the requirements. 
 The Department of Health, in c
ollaboration with partners such as the Vermont 
Information Technology 
Leaders (VITL
), is working to onboard additional sites to HL7 messaging, helping to ensure that as many 
providers are reporting in near real
-time as possible. Direct reporting will be us
ed for some smaller sites, 
but it is likely that some third
-party batch files will still be submitted. These files will not meet the 24
-hour 
reporting requirement. We hope to limit the number of providers in this category and for those that do, 

efforts are
 underway to increase the frequency at which they submit their files.
 Vermont also has an IT/Data Workgroup, representing agencies from varied parts of state government 
working together to increase the proportion of providers that will be able to reporting
 within the 24
-hour 
time frame. These activities 
include
, but
 are not limited 
to, connection to the IZ Gateway via the CDC 
WSDL, implementing the use of VAMS for providers without connection to the IIS, increasing capacity for 

accepting and merging third
-party batch files, streamlining HL7 onboarding processes, and assessing 
business rules within the IIS system for opportunities to allow more efficient acceptance of immunization 
records via HL7.
    33 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 E. Describe how your jurisdiction will monitor provider
-level da
ta to ensure each dose of COVID
-19 
vaccine administered is fully documented and reported every 24 hours as well as steps to be taken 
when providers do not comply with documentation and reporting requirements.
 The Vermont IIS will be used to monitor provide
r level data and doses reported in 
several
 ways, including 
both those reported via VAMS and those reported via other established mechanisms. New reports will be 
created to ensure the Vermont IIS™ ability to assess the number of doses administered, as required by the 
CDC reporting requirements. As 
reporting requirements become more clear, additional reports will also be 
identified and developed. 
 For sites with an established reporting connection to the Vermont IIS, existing reports within the Vermont 
IIS will also be used to report on immunizations
 administered overall and by site. For sites that have an 
established connection to the Vermont IIS reports will also be generated by site.
  For open and closed 
PODs 
that use VAMS for scheduling and reporting, and which are added to the 
Vermont IIS system 
via the IZ Gateway, the IIS will create and run queries allowing for assessment of doses 

administered at the sites and compare them with doses distributed via VIMS. 
 As needed, we will also utilize tools within VAMS to monitor immunizations given through t
hat system 
separate from those captured in the Vermont IIS via other mechanisms.
 Compliance with documentation and reporting requirements has not historically been a problem for the 
Vermont IIS. If needed in this response, the Vermont IIS will engage with 
departmental leadership and 
legal counsel on any actions needed to ensure compliance.
   F. Describe how your jurisdiction will generate and use COVID
-19 vaccination coverage reports. 
 Vaccination coverage reports are expected to be used to identify gaps in va
ccine uptake and target 
vaccination efforts. It is also expected that reports will be used in combination with outbreak data as the 
response moves forward. Additional uses will likely be identified in the future. 
 In anticipation of these uses, the IIS sta
ff is working in concert with 
ADS
 to develop a dashboard system. 
While still in development, at a minimum, the dashboard is expected to demonstrate the number of 

individuals who have been vaccinated, by demographic variables. Demographics under considerati
on 
include, age, sex, race and ethnicity, hospital service area, county, and town. 
 The Vermont IIS also has existing reporting tools that will be leveraged for reporting throughout the 

COVID
-19 vaccination response. For example, the
 VT-IIS
 includes a repo
rt that allow practices to run 
coverage reports on any age group of patients. Creation of new reports within the V
T IIS are also under 
consideration. For example, reporting on CVX code and their uptake within different locations or within 
different populat
ions.
  As more details become available (e.g., (CVX codes, scheduling guidance for each formulation) we will 
work update the 
VT 
IIS forecasting algorithm (HLN™s Immunization Calculation Engine) to update settings 
so that COVID
-19 specific forecasting repor
ts can be run in the VT
 IIS.

  *Update
d* In preparation for the COVID
-19 vaccination, the team developed a web dashboard tracking flu 
vaccination for the 2020
-2021 flu season. The dashboard highlights the number of individuals who 
have been vaccinated and details demographic breakdowns including age, sex, race, ethnicity, an
d 
location (county and town). Another view details the inventory, ordering and shipping of flu vaccines. 
The dashboard has been well
-received. Once COVID
-19 vaccination begins, it will be straight
-forward 
to replicate the dashboard to reflect COVID
-19 vacc
inations. 
 In addition, efforts are underway as we prepare to track vaccination coverage among priority 
populations in Phase I. This view will track progress and uptake across the various priority populations 
and enable the State to identify outreach oppor
tunities to increase uptake or improve the overall 
process.

 Section 10: COVID
-19 Vaccination Second
-Dose Reminders
 A.
 Describe all methods your jurisdiction will use to remind COVID
-19 vaccine recipients of the need for a 
second dose, 
including planned redundancy of reminder methods.
 The V
T IIS has utilized a centralized reminder recall process for many years. The standard approach has 
been limited to specific child age cohorts, and a postal reminder. However, the functionality for running a 
recall is built into the 
VT 
IIS application and ca
n be run for any age group and will generate either mailing 
labels or a line list with phone numbers.
 We also have the ability to run reports from the 
VT 
IIS data warehouse to identify and contact persons 
who received one dose of vaccine, but not the secon
d, and to centrally identify situations where 
immunizers may have administered an incorrect (wrong formulation) or invalid (too soon) dose. Medical 

practices can run invalid dose reports for their patients as well.
 In addition to the centralized reminders,
 any primary care medical practice also has the capacity to run a 
recall list (same mailing label/line list capability) from within the V
T IIS specifically for their patients who 
are not up to date. In addition, they may run a list of their patients who ha
ve received a dose of COVID
-19 
vaccine, and the date of that dose. A provider tutorial was developed to assist V
T IIS users in using this 
report. Moving forward the IIS will monitor support needs and develop additional tutorials as needed.
 A limitation of 
the VT IIS is that new immunizing sites (like fire department or other employer pop
-up 
clinics) are not ﬁmedical practicesﬂ in the IIS, and they do not have access to the recall reports for the 

people they immunized. However, we anticipate that most of the
se sites will be using VAMS to schedule 

patients and report immunizations, so recall functionality will be available to them via that system.
 All recall strategies require pre
-existence of a CVX code and ACIP recommendation, with enough lead time 
for our f
orecasting algorithm (HLN™s Immunization Calculation Engine) to be updated.
  *Update
d*   1. Reminders and Appointment Scheduling by Providers 
Œ During training opportunities, VDH will 
inform all providers that COVID vaccine that require a second dose and 
that part of their responsibility 
is to assure patients they provide a first dose to are informed of the need for a second dose and take 
steps to facilitate this happening.
  This includes scheduling a follow
-up at the time of the first dose 
whenever possib
le, distributing reminder cards, encouraging smart phone picture capture/ reminder, 
as well as additional steps that might be within their ability such as sending appointment reminders or 

calls. If healthcare providers counsel vaccine recipients to utilize
 v-safe, then patients will receive 
second dose reminders through that program.
  2. Patient Second Dose Date Reports
 -- A report will be developed that identifies all persons who have 
received one dose of a COVID Vaccine that requires a second dose but have n
ot yet received a second 
dose.
  Specific requirements will be confirmed
. A version of the report showing all Vermont practices 
will be available for VDH staff.
  A version will also be developed that can be run by practices to assist 
as needed in their effo
rts to assure patients are scheduled to receive a second dose. 
   3. Recall Notices from VDH
 Œ A report will be developed that identifies all persons who received a COVID 
vaccine that requires a second dose who a) have not received that second dose and b) the
 date has 
passed for which they are eligible to receive a second dose. 
  This report will be used to generate a 
mailed ﬁrecallﬂ notice to the patient.
   It is anticipated that the report data will be used to produce a 
  36 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
 mail merge for letters that include in
formation specific to the vaccine given and time frame.
  This mail 
merge and mailing will be facilitated by VDH staff.

 Section 11: COVID
-19 Requirements for IISs or Other External Systems
 A.
 Describe your jurisdiction™s solution for documenting vaccine 
administration in temporary or high
-volume vaccination settings (e.g., CDC mobile app, 
IIS,
 or module that interfaces with the IIS, or other 
jurisdiction
-based solution). Include planned contingencies for network outages or other access issues.
 Vermont was a pilot site for the VAMS application and plans to utilize that solution as an option for 
reporting, especially at sites without previous relationship with the VT IIS. 
 Vermont also has a well
-established and highly utilized IIS. Nearly all V
ermont
 hospitals and most primary 
care sites are directly reporting immunizations in their electronic health record via HL7 message. Existing 

provider systems that meet CDC data reporting requirements, outlined in the COVID
-19 Provider 
Agreement, will be uti
lized.
 Provider systems that are unable to meet the CDC data reporting 
requirements will be offered the VAMS system. 
 Vermont is working with Vermont Information Technology Leaders 
(VITL
), Vermont™s H
ealth Information 
Exchange (H
IE), to onboard as many new
 HL7 senders as possible prior to the release of COVID
-19 vaccine. 
 Vermont is also offering the option of direct reporting (manual entry) into the 
VT 
IIS application, and has 
developed short video tutorials for training new users. Direct entry will be uti
lized in low volume 
applications. 
 The V
T IIS continues to seek data from all possible sources including administrating site and health 
insurers (billing data). The VT IIS is prepared for (and has experience with) the HL7 feed going down. 
 The Vermont IIS 
is robust, but if the internet is not available, it is not accessible. We anticipate this 
occurring rarely and in such situations paper records would be utilized, with data entry used to enter the 
information into VAMS or the
 VT IIS.
 B.
 List the variables you
r jurisdiction™s IIS or other system will be able to capture for persons who will 
receive COVID
-19 vaccine, including but not limited to age, race/ethnicity, chronic medical conditions,

  C.
 Describe your jurisdiction™s current capacity for data exchange, 
storage, and reporting as well as any 
planned improvements (including timelines) to accommodate the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program.
 Vermont has executed a Data 
Use 
Agreement (DUA) 
with the Association of Public Health Laboratories
 for 
Connect and Access with the IZ Gateway. We 
await the release of the 
CDC 
DUA addressing reporting to 
the CDC
 for national coverage analyses
.  Vermont has a state law which limits sharing of identifiable data 
and we will adhere to these statutes.
 Vermont
 is working to install the CDC WSDL to enable receipt of VAMS data from the IZ Gateway. HL7 
version 2.5.1 is currently used by the V
T IIS with uni
-directional capacity. The Agency of Digital Services 
development team is working to assure our systems 
can
 report all required data.
 However, we need final 
specifications from CDC regarding the format and means for reporting these data.
  D.
 Describe plans to rapidly enroll and onboard to the IIS those vaccination provider facilities and settings 
expected to serve he
althcare personnel (e.g., paid and unpaid personnel working in healthcare 
settings, including vaccinators, pharmacy staff, and ancillary staff) and other essential workers.
 The
 Immunization Program has developed a plan for enrollment of facilities, beginni
ng with those that will 
provide vaccine to those in Tier 1A and 1B. The COVID
-19 Vaccine Planning group is working out the 
logistics for ensuring enrolled providers can submit vaccines administered within 24 hours. Ordering will 
be completed through the Va
ccine Inventory Management System
 (VIMS)
. Engagement with the 
VT 
IIS 
depends on whether the site will use VAMS or the 
VT 
IIS for reporting. Anyone using the 
VT 
IIS to report 
may apply for a username and password 
Œ and nearly all sites that gave immunizatio
ns prior to COVID
-19 already have accounts. We have established a triaged phone line to manage increased volume of calls for 

access, password resets, and records requests.
  E. Describe your jurisdiction™s 
status
 and plans to onboard to the IZ Gateway 
Connect
 and Share
 components.
 Vermont has an executed DUA for Connect. At this time Vermont will not participate in the Share 

component due to limitations with current state statute. Agency of Data Services staff are
 working to 
implement the CDC WSDL enabling our ability to Connect. Our expectation is that CDC will complete 
onboarding
      39 Vermont Department of Health
  Version 2.0
  F. Describe the status of establishing:
 1. Data use agreement with the Association of Public Health Laboratories to participate in the IZ
 Gateway
 Vermont
™s
 Legal team executed the DUA for Connect, but not Share. 
 2. Data use agreement with CDC for national coverage analyses
 (see 
*Plan Update*
 below)
 *Update
d* A data use agreement (DUA) was executed with VDH and the CDC, effective 
November 16, 2020, which 1) 
describes the data needed for the monitoring of COVID
-19 vaccine update; 2)describes the methods and 
parties within the CDC, HHS, and other users who will be authorized to access, display, or share these 
data; 3) describes platf
orms for the rapid collection, transmission, use, storage, and maintenance of 

vaccine administration data available to jurisdictions; 4) establishes the terms and conditions for sharing, 
protection, and use of these data with CDC, HHS, and other federal pa
rtners; and 5) sets forth roles and 
responsibilities of each party.
 Memorandum 
of Understanding to share data with other jurisdictions via 
the IZ Gateway Share component
 Vermont has chosen not to 
implement
 the IZ Gateway Share at this time. The V
T IIS has an existing 
interstate data exchange 
agreement 
with New York State. 
  G.
 Describe planned backup solutions for offline use if internet connectivity is lost or not possible.
   If the information has been captured on paper, direct entry into an electron
ic health record, VAMS, or the 
VT 
IIS is always an option. Vermont has the capacity to import a flat file and has published minimum 
requirements for creating such a file.
   H. Describe how your jurisdiction will monitor data quality and the steps to be 
taken to ensure data are 
available, complete, timely, valid, accurate, consistent, and unique.
 Vermont has specialized software designed to identify data issues, and a process for auto
-merge match of 
duplicate records. Our import processes are designed to 
prevent duplicate information (both at the 

patient and the vaccine level) from being imported. Each import is followed by the generation of an 
import report that summarizes the number of records imported, those not imported (and the reasons 
why), and those
 that errored out of the process. Our team of analysts have years of experience in 
identifying potential issues, including but not limited 
to unusual number of immunizations for a patient, 
bad lot numbers, and number of immunizations from a particular site

 Section 13: Regulatory Considerations for COVID
-19 Vaccination
 A. Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure enrolled COVID
-19 vaccination providers are aware of, know 
where to locat
e, and understand the information in any Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) fact 
sheets for providers and vaccine recipients or vaccine information statements (VISs), as applicable.
 Emergency Use Authorization 
 Under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allows for a vaccine to 
be used prior to full FDA licensure. In anticipation of an EUA, VDH will prepare providers to look to the 
EUA to determine how a COVID
-19 vaccine should be
 used and any conditions that must be met when 
using the vaccine. All providers that enroll to receive COVID
-19 vaccine will receive guidance on where to 
access an 
up
-to-date
 EUA fact sheet. It will most likely be available on the FDA, CDC, and VDH website
s. Al
l providers that enroll to receive COVID
-19 vaccine will receive materials outlining their responsibilities. 
One of those items will be the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) fact sheets. 
Another avenue used to 
ensure providers have access to the EUA i
s through the 
Vermont™s Immunization Bulletin (VIB)
, which
 is 
sent out monthly to all enrolled providers
. The link to the EUA will be sent to all enrolled providers 
electronically and training that will occur for all practices enrolling to receive COVID
-19 vaccine will 
emphasize the requirement to provide the most updated version to a patient before vaccine is 

administered. 
 A webinar to Phase 1
-A providers will include a secti
on on specifics around an Emergency Use 
Authorization. This webinar will be recor
ded and available for viewing at a later date.
 Additional webinars will be available as the phases progress to meet the needs to each type of provider.
 Office hours will be utilized to educate providers on various subjects specific to vaccination, includin
g 
safety and safety procedures. There will be an hour of time that providers can log in to ask questions 

specific to safety. This will be in addition to the planned provider webinars.
 Once a vaccine information statement (VIS) is created, which will happen
 when the vaccine is added to the 
Vaccine Injury Table, it will be required, by the State of Vermont, that all enrolled providers distribute it 
before a vaccine is given. Once a VIS is produced, the Vermont Department of Health will make it available 
on th
e website. When
 the
 Vaccine for 
Children (VFC) program 
compliance site visits are restarted, all site 
visitors will ensure that a practice has up to date VISs to give to patients. The State of Vermont requires 
that when a vaccine provider administers a vac
cine, the version of the VIS is updated in the Vermont 
Immunization Registry (IMR). This will be required for COVID
-19 vaccine once a VIS is created and 
distributed.
 B. Describe how your jurisdiction will instruct enrolled COVID
-19 vaccination providers to pr
ovide 
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) fact sheets or vaccine information statements (VISs), as 

applicable, to each vaccine recipient prior to vaccine administration. 
 All providers enrolling to receive COVID
-19 vaccine will be instructed to provide eithe
r a EUA fact sheet or 
a VIS for COVID
-19 vaccine to the patient or parent/guardian prior to administering the vaccine. When 
these materials are released, they will be sent electronically to all enrolled practices and made available 

on the Health Department
 websit
e.

 *Update
d* An EUA fact sheet for vaccination providers will replace the package insert found with the vaccine, while 
the EUA fact sheet for 
recipients
 will replace the VIS for licensed vaccines. The fact sheet for 
recipients
 will 
serve in the place of a VIS until the
 EUA is discontinued. Vaccine providers are required by law to
 give a 
patient
 or guardian the EUA fact sheet before vaccine administration. VDH will ensure all vaccine 
providers have access to the EUA fact sheets by providing them in the ancillary kit
s sen
t from VDH™s depot 
when doses are re
-distributed. The EUA fact sheets will also be available on VDH™s COVID
-19 vaccine

the 
requirement and process for
 report
ing
 adverse events
 following vaccination
 to the Vaccine Adverse 
Event Reporting System (VAERS).
 *Update
d*  Vaccine Adverse E
vent Reporting System (VAERS)
 Vermont requires that all adverse events following any vaccination are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System (VAERS)
 as stated by Vermont statute 
18 V.S.A. § 1132
. It states that ﬁA health care 
practitioner administering vaccinations shall report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting 
System, in 
consultation with the patient, or if a minor, the patient™s parent or guardian, all significant adverse events that 
occur a
fter vaccination of adults and children, even if the practitioner is unsure whether a vaccine caused the 
adverse event.ﬂ 
 A webinar to Phase 1
-A providers will include a 
section dedicated to safety with an overview of the VAERS 
system
. Additional webinars 
will be available as the phases progress to meet the needs to each type of 
providers. 
Anyone can submit to the VAERS, including, patients, family members, healthcare providers
, 
vaccine manufacturers, and the general public. 
VDH encourages anyone who has a 
reaction following a 
vaccine to contact their healthcare provider to work together to report the adverse event through the VAERS 
online reporting form at 
https://vaers.hhs.gov/
.  Information about VAERS 
reporting will be disseminated as follows:
  During enrollment, providers sign the agreement that denotes that vaccination providers who receive 
and administer COVID
-19 vaccine ﬁmust report moderate and severe adverse events following 
vaccination to the Vacc
ine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).ﬂ
  Once enrolled, providers receive education on VAERS overseen by Immunization Program staff, 

including:
 o How to access
? o How and when to report
? o Who can report an adverse event following vaccination
?  Providers will
 attend a webinar with a section dedicated to safety with an overview of VAERS. 
Additional webinars will be available as the phases progress to meet the needs of each type of 
provider. 
  Open office hours will be available before and after vaccine is releas
ed to answer outlying questions 
providers may have. This will be an hour of time that providers can log online to ask questions specific 
to one topic. One of these days will be dedicated to safety and the VAERS system.
  When compliance visits resume, site v
isitors will review VAERS in person at every compliance site visit 
during the education portion offering paper materials on the system, as well as online access 

information.
 Materials that are developed by the CDC or VDH will be disseminated to all practic
es enrolled to administer 
COVID
-19 vaccine, as well as those materials available on the VDH website
 in the COVID
-19 vaccine section
. The VDH website 
also 
has a section entitled ﬁImmunization and Health Care Professionals.ﬂ This section 
contains a resource 
tab, which links to the VAERS online reporting system. CDC or VDH

 Section 15: COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Monitoring
 A. Describe
 your
 jurisdiction™s
 methods and
 procedures for monitoring
 progress 
in COVID
-19 Vaccination 
Program implementation, including:
  Provider enrollment
  Access to COVID
-19 vaccination services by population in all phases of implementation
  IIS or other designated system performance
  Data reporting to CDC
  Provider
-level data reportin
g  Vaccine ordering and distribution
  1- and 2-dose COVID
-19 vaccination coverage
  As indicated by Vermont™s successful efforts to contain COVID
-19 
disease, there is full support to successfully 
implement the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program through all levels o
f state government
 and the medical 
community.
 By creating a Vaccination Branch within the VDH Health Operations Center
, the Immunization Program has 
access to the staffing, resources and
 support needed to plan and implement a com
prehensive 
vaccination 
program.
 The Vaccination Branch 
includes four sections: immunization program operations, technical 
response, POD (mass vaccination) planning and data management
. Staff are being onboarded to fully support 
this work.
 For key areas such as enroll
men
t, IIS 
and other system performance and 
data reporting to the CDC
 - detailed 
tracking spreads
heets are utilized at weekly meetings to identify leads, assess progress, set 
timelines,
 and
 ident
ify 
areas that are ﬁat riskﬂ
. If ﬁat riskﬂ, barriers are noted
, and the plan is reassessed.
 Describe your jurisdiction™s methods and procedures for monitoring r
esources
, including:
  Large scale health emergencies are managed by the Health Department™s Health Operations Center (HOC)
, 
which is currently activated.  
The
 HOC follows standard FEMA Incident Command and Control procedures.  
The department utilizes the on
-line emergency management platform called Web EOC and Microsoft Teams 
sites to track and manage resources.  
  Budget
-VDH Finance
 Section Chief
 keeps track of
 the budget
  Staffing
-The Health Operations Center has a COOP/HOC Staffing team that procures staffing 
need
ed for this incident
  Supplies
- The Health Operations Center has a Logistics Section responsible to procure any needed 
logistical items.
 If 
that 
section cannot
 procure what is needed
, then the request is sent up to the 
State 
Emergency 
Operations 
Center Medical Logistics Section 
to procure.

ommunication
, including:
   Message deliver
y 
  Reception 
of communication messages and materials among target audiences throughout 
jurisdiction

  Version 2.0
 The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communications (CERC) Team within the Health Department™s Health 
Operations Center, monitors communications in a 
variety of ways to understand and assess the success of our 
messaging, including but not limited to:
  Evaluation of social media metrics for paid content (Click Through Rates, Impressions, Reach, 
Frequency, etc.)
  Monitoring of Health Department web page tra
ffic and other key analytics (
e.g.,
 time spent on page, 
bounce rate, etc.)
  Monitor public inquiries to our COVID
-19 Main Call Center and Public Inquiries Inbox to assess public 
concerns and perceptions to inform our messaging when appropriate
  Monitor questions from media outlets
  Constantly evaluate messaging based on the evolving nature of the COVID
-19 response and 
implement course corrections as needed
  C. Describe your jurisdiction™s methods and procedures for monitoring l
ocal
-level 
situational 
awareness 
(i.e., strategies, activities,
 progress
, etc.)
.  VDH 
is a centralized public health department with 
an 
Office of Local Health
, with 1
2 Local Health 
Offices
. Situational level
 monitoring 
is conducted using data and information reported by the Loca
l Health Offices, community surveys and GIS mapping
. Public health statistics also provides extensive 
information on local areas Routine meetings are held with the 12 LHO™s to identify emerging issues, 

gather information and develop plans
. Close coordinati
on was required during a pertussis outbreak 
and in recent effort to prevent a hepatitis A outbreak.
  D. Describe the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program metrics (e.g., vaccination provider 
enrollment
, doses 
distributed, doses administered, vaccination coverage), if 
any, that will be posted on your jurisdiction™s 
public
-facing website, including the exact web location of placement.
 Work is underway to develop an internal and public facing dashboard
 to share key information with all 
stakeholders.
 The dashboard will build upon the current 
Vermont 
COVID
-19 Dashboard
. Metrics 
for the COVID
-19 Vaccination Campaign in Vermont 
have
 not
 been
 finalized at this time but will 
likely include:
  Enrollment by facility type, location
  Doses distributed by facility type, location
  Doses administered (from the Immunization Reg
istry)
  COVID
-19 vaccination coverage by county, LHO and 
HAS
  Adverse events reported in VAERS by degree of severity and age

Executive 
Summary
 
Covid
-
19 has laid bare the challenges of lack of universal broadband in Vermont. In the midst of 
a pandemic, inequities in availability and affordability of broadband create further inequities in 
areas such as education, telehealth, and ability to 
work from home. 
 
To understand and address those challenges on an emergency basis, this 
Covid
-
19 Emergency 
Telecommunication Plan (Report) was commissioned by the Vermont Department of Public 
Service in October 2020. 
The Report is intended to meet the
 
requ
irements of 
Section 15 of H.966
, 
an act relating to COVID
-
19 funding and assistance for broa
dband connectivity, housing, and 
economic relief

funds to provide research and recommenda
tions regarding how to address, in the near term, the 
immediate connectivity crisis created by 
Covid
-
19.

The Report was prepared in October and 
November 2020 by a project team led by CTC Technology & Energy and Rural Innovation 
Strategies, Inc.
 
1.1
 
The Scope of 
T
his Report
 
The research undertaken for this Report illuminates and illustrates the short
-
term connectivity 
challenges that require immediate effort to minimize the harm to Vermonters during the 
pandemic. Despite the best efforts of stakeholde
rs, many students are not receiving instruction, 
workers are not able to work remotely from home, patients who want telehealth services are 
struggling to connect, and doctors participating in prudent quarantine practices are unable to 
connect to hospitals 
and patients. Even citizens hoping to stay connected to their municipal 

weather approaching, these challenges are likely only to further exacerbate inequitable ac
cess 
to education, work, healthcare and the democratic process.
 
 
The research for this Report also reinforces the importance of accelerating progress toward the 

Mbps 
broadband goal. For example, surveys conducted as part of this effort 
foun
d that, even among Vermonters who do have access to broadband, satisfaction with current 
internet service has decreased during the pandemic; approximately one
-
third of respondents to 
an online survey express dissatisfaction with connection speed and reliab
ility during the 
pandemic.
 
 

this Report was not intended to accomplish: It does not represent a long
-
term strategy to meet 

ntial 100/100 goal.

The consulting team heard from many stakeholders the hope that this Report would offer the 

However, given the scope established for this effor
t and the source of funding for the work, this 
Report is focused on short
-
term efforts, not long
-
term strategy. Indeed, given the short time 
horizon for executing any strategy recommended by this Report, it does not incorporate 
recommendations regarding me
dium
-
 
or long
-
term strategies or technologies, such as 
construction of fiber

to

Stated simply: 
This Report sh
ould be understood as a complement rather than an alternative to 
long
-
term planning
 

recommend that Vermont continue with that longer
-
term planning once the immediate 
emergency has been addr
essed.
 
 
In light of the scope of this Report, this analysis follows three key principles:
 
1.
 
Recommendations in this plan are intended to address immediate, urgent needs during 
the pandemic.
 
2.

3.
 
Wherever possible, recommendations for short

The Report builds on
 

Department of Public Service has developed more granular and up
-
to
-
date data on broadband 
availability than perhaps any other State. The electric utilities in the State share crucial d
ata 
regarding utility poles and fiber assets. Public, Education and Governmental Television (PEG TV) 
stations and libraries have taken on new and critical roles during the pandemic, as educational 
content, 
Covid
 
safety guidelines, and municipal events need
 
to be disseminated to the public in 
new ways. The State also moved very quickly to deploy centrally located public hotspots and 
invested in programs to identify people with distinct needs and bring Vermonters online quickly.

Summary of Tasks
 
Over the cour
se of October and early November 2020, the project team conducted quantitative 
and qualitative research to understand the use of telecommunications services during the 
Covid
-
19 pandemic and the gaps that still exist in Vermont.

The 
Report
 
is based on data
 
developed in October and November 2020, and there exist some pending processes 
that may impact the 
recommendations made here. For example, the status of federal Coronavirus financial support 
is unclear, and there exists potential for additional funding should another federal stimulus be made available or

based firm, provided 
regulatory and legal consultation regarding these issues.

Specifically, the project team undertook the following activities:
 
1.
 
Assessed the 
current state of commercial and residential telecommunications 
infrastructure and services and surveyed Vermont residents and businesses:
4
 
The effort 

has 
performed during the pandemic to lay the groundwork for near
-
term changes that should 
be considered in light of the emergency.
 
The team undertook multiple surveys of
 
Vermont 
residents and businesses, in cooperation and consultation with the Agency of Commerce 
and Community Development (ACCD) and the relevant departments of State government, 
to determine what telecommunications services are needed during the pandemic w
ith 
respect to the education, healthcare, public safety, and workforce training sectors. 
Specifically, the team
 
conducted online surveys of Vermont residents and businesses and 
currently has underway a telephone survey of unserved residences.
5
 
2.
 
Evaluated S
tate
-
owned and managed telecommunications systems and related 
infrastructure:
6
 
In this task, the project team analyzed public sector 
telecommunications 
systems and related infrastructure and evaluated the need to provide the best available 
and affordable 
technology for use by State and local government, public safety, 
educational institutions, community media, nonprofit organizations performing 
governmental functions, and other community anchor institutions. In particular, we 
analyzed how publicly
-
owned in
frastructure has performed during the pandemic and 
what needs have emerged as a result of this emergency. To this end, the team 
conducted 
more than 50 interviews of Communications Union Districts (CUDs), ISPs, health care 
 
should the deadline for spending the current CRF 
money be extended. In addition, the ongoing Rural Digital 

connectivity in Vermont in the coming year

Given
 
the urgency of the 
Covid

19 pan
demic and the short timeline for writing this plan, 
as well as the plan for 
public comment, this 
Report
 
will be 
further refined in the final submission.
 
Two elements to note that will be 
included in the final 
Report
 
are the full legal review of these recom
mendations, and results from an ongoing phone 
survey of Vermont residents

ally valid mail survey of thousands of Vermont 
households, but the urgent and accelerated nature of the engagement made infeasible a methodology that would 
require several months of effort. 
As of the date of this writing, 
a polling firm is conducting a pho
ne survey of 
Vermont residents in areas without internet of at least 25/3. The results 
of 
the phone survey will be incorporated 
into the final version of the 
Report
.
 
The phone survey is focused only on Vermont residents thought to have little 
to no 
broadband connection, to correct for the obvious limitations of a residential survey conducted online
.

Assessed status, coverage, and capacity of telecommunications networks and services:
7
 
The project team assessed the status, cover
age, and capacity of telecommunications 
networks and services available throughout Vermont in light of how the pandemic has 
affected the capacity of current networks, with particular focus on telehealth and 
distance learning requirements. To this end, the 
team 
conducted dozens of interviews 
and surveys of health care professionals and school superintendents, among other critical 
stakeholders. In addition, robust geospatial and mapping analysis was performed to 
understand the options for reaching as many Ver
monters as possible in response to the 
pandemic.

various cellular service data from drive tes
ts, and data from the census.

Assessed opportunities for shared infrastructure:
8
 
The project team completed an 
assessment of opportunities for shared infrastructure, open access, and neutral host 
wireless facilities to guide deployment of new technology 
that can assist the State in 
responding to, and recovering from, the pandemic. We concluded that strategies related 
to neutral host infrastructure are long
-
term in nature and advise against policy changes 
in the short
-
term to deal with the pandemic; we rec
ommend instead that these long
-
term 
strategies be considered in the context of a long
-
term, comprehensive broadband plan.

Analyzed PEG TV responses to the pandemic:
9
 
PEG access media organizations were 
assessed
 
with particular attention to changes brought
 
on by the pandemic and how PEG 
Access has been leveraged to address the crisis in the context of the S

communications needs.
 
To this end, we interviewed key PEG stakeholders and experts.
 
6.
 
Analyzed strategies to use public ownership and contro
l of rights
-
of
-
way to expand 
broadband and increase network resiliency during the pandemic:
10
 
The project team 
was tasked to develop short
-
term measures that the State can undertake to leverage its 
ownership and management of the public rights
-
of
-
way to cr
eate opportunities for 
accelerating the buildout of fiber
-
optic broadband and for increasing network resiliency 
capacity. We concluded that strategies related to ownership and management of rights

Summary of Findings
 
 
Based on the Tasks described above, this Report finds the following:
 
 

 
Institutional and governmental telecommunications system
s have been resilient during 
the pandemic, and emergency plans and adaptations have successfully minimized gaps in 
operations of government services. Most commercial business locations are generally 
served by adequate broadband.
 

 
Broadband use has increased
 
dramatically since the start of the pandemic, as would be 
expected. For example, respondents to an online poll report increased u
se of the internet 
for telemedicine (an increase from 19 percent to 75 percent) and for civic engagement 
(an increase from 33 
percent to 74 percent). Additionally, 62 percent of respondents use

the internet for teleworking on a daily basis, compared with 21 percent of respondents 
before the pandemic.
 

 
There exist considerable challenges with respect to insufficient residential 
tel
ecommunications infrastructure. Many Vermonters are struggling with connectivity for 
remote work, online education, and telehealth (including doctors in quarantine who 
cannot connect to hospitals and patients from home with video conferencing). For 
example
, 
four in 10 respondents to a residential survey reported that they have 
experienced connectivity issues during telehealth appointments. Overall, satisfaction 
with internet service aspects has decreased during the pandemic, particularly for speed 
and relia
bility of service. More than one
-
half of respondents are not at all satisfied 
(approximately one
-
third) or are only slightly satisfied (approximately one
-
fifth) with 
connection speed and reliability during the pandemic.
 

 
Low
-
income Vermonters in particular 
are facing challenges accessing broadband and 
getting assistance. For example, a survey of families connected to the internet suggests 
that more low
-
income respondents to the survey who currently have service had 
applications to ISP low
-
income programs den
ied than those who were able to enroll.
 

 
Small businesses, remote workers, parents, patients, and civically engaged Vermonters 
are learning digital skills quickly, but are still struggling to understand how to use 
connectivity tools during the pandemic.
 

 
Many municipalities have struggled to engage citizens and elected officials via online 
tools, and few have made plans for larger engagement challenges like Town Meeting Day. 
In some cases, PEG TV is filling the gap. 
Sixteen percent of all respondents to a 
survey 
report viewing PEG TV content during the Covid
-
19 pandemic. Among those who viewed 
PEG programming, the most commonly accessed content was broadcasts of municipal 
functions, cited by 72 percent of respondents. One

half of PEG viewers accessed

Summary of Recommendations
 
Given that, for the most part, the immediate challenge for connectivity during the pandemic 
appears to be on the residential rather than business or institutional fronts, this 
Report
 
focuses 
its recommendati
ons on the needs of the following categories of Vermonters:
 
1.
 
Served but low
-
income
: This category is of those Vermonters who have available 
broadband service of 25/3 or more, but may not be able to afford service

2.
 
Unserved but able to pay
: This category is o
f those Vermonters without access to 
broadband

who could and would pay for service, if the infrastructure was made 
available
 
3.
 
Unserved 
and
 
low
-
income
: Vermonters without access to broadband who also need 
assistance paying for monthly service
 
 
Addressing the needs of these Vermonters requires work and programming in three categories 
that are responsive to the needs: First, we recommend infrastructure deployments to enable 
short
-
term solutions to address the needs of the unserved. Second, we reco
mmend service 
subsidies for low
-
income Vermonters who may struggle to afford broadband service in the 
current economic crisis. Finally, we recommend execution capacity to reach everyone across the 
State. The recommendations are based on the assumption that
 
the State can mobilize financial 
and staff/contract resources to act quickly.
 
 
1.4.1
 
Recommendation: Provide a Broadband Service Subsidy to Low
-
Income 
Vermonters During the Pandemic
 
The Vermont Department of Public Service has already developed a successful eff
ort to 

crisis. We recommend that the State complement that effort, and expand it, by also focusing 
resources on providing free broadband to low
-
income families tha
t may not already have service 
to their homes because of the barrier of cost.
 
Specifically, the State could purchase services in bulk from providers that currently serve 
communities throughout Vermont, then provide codes for qualified residents to redeem f
or free 
service from any participating provider

thus completely eliminating cost as a barrier to 
adoption. 
 
This approach would enable the State to use its large
-
scale purchasing power to realize 
efficiencies and ensure competitive pricing

reducing its cos
ts both in total and on a per
-

underutilized low
-
cost programs such as Comcast internet Essentials and Spectrum Internet 
Assist. The State could use a quick
-
turnar
ound procurement process to engage internet service 
providers willing to offer low pricing, flexibility, and high
-
quality customer service. 
 
Given the reality of service availability in Vermont, the program would offer codes for service 
over fixed networks
 
wherever possible and mobile hotspots everywhere else.
 
To maximize participation and the overall impact of this approach, the State would need to make 
the process as simple as possible for residents and would need to commit to providing support 
and guidan
ce to families as they navigate the program. Ideally, eligible residents would receive

communications through multiple channels

both 
analog and digital

that 
clearly describe the 

subscribing to 
service from the participating provider of their choice. 
 
For purpose of equity and ease of program deployment, eligibility should be based on income 

r the 
National School Lunch Program. This will require collaboration and data sharing by public school 
systems or other institutions. 
 
Assuming an average cost per household of $350 for 12 months, representing service, 
equipment, and installation, and appr
oximately 20,000 eligible households, we estimate the 
potential cost of a program like this could be $7 million in the first year.

After consideration of the Emergency Connectivity Initiative, 60,511 homes, or approximately 20 
percent of Vermont households, are not served by wireline service that meets the federal 
definition of broadband (25 Mbps 
download and 3 Mbps upload) and thus face difficulty working 
remotely, learning remotely, or obtaining telemedicine services over broadband.
 
 
This Report considers possible approaches for addressing these broadband gaps. While the 
optimal long
-
term approac
h is to connect unserved premises with fiber or other high
-
speed 
wireline services, we recommend an emergency approach that accomplishes the following: 
 
1.
 
Use of Mobile
. Leverages the commercial mobile broadband networks that serve most of 
Vermont, 
including areas unserved by wired 25/3 broadband services. Households 
without fixed broadband service can use a mobile hotspot device to access service. We 
have identified 44,420 households (73 percent of the 60,511 unserved households) in this 
category th
rough use of State drive test data, State tower data, and AT&T data regarding 
planned 2020 FirstNet expansion.
 
2.
 
Line Extensions.
 
Pays to extend cable or fiber service to small unserved pockets within or 
adjacent to otherwise
-
served areas. These can be built
 
quickly and will be difficult to serve 
by a new fiber provider such as a Community Utility District. We identified 2,023 homes 
in this category using a mapping algorithm that identifies small unserved areas in mostly
-
served towns

and we estimate this will
 
cost $5.6 million.
 
3.
 
Rooftop Boosters.
 
Identifies where the use of rooftop booster antennas could help 
households with marginal mobile broadband service attain service at acceptable speeds 
and provide equipment and installation services, along with the hots
pot device. We 
 Covid
-

identify 3,700 additional households in this category by selecting areas with lower signal 
level thresholds for mobile broadband, but at levels that can be boosted to provide 
acceptable service.
 
1.4.3
 
Recommendation: Develop a Broadband Corps 
 
To 
support Vermonters in their adoption and use of broadband, we recommend development of 
a Broadband Corps. The Corps would be a statewide team dedicated to supporting CUDs and 
mobilizing the people power necessary to confirm mobile hotspot options, assist w
ith 
nontechnical installations, and provide technical support for low income and technology 
challenged Vermonters. The Corps would launch before December 30 and would continue over 
the next 8 to 10 months, transitioning to longer term data collection (such
 
as pole assessments) 
in the late spring once emergency connections are completed. 
 
Consistently, during the research for this Report, stakeholders demonstrated need for more 
hands
-
on resources to assist with the technical issues that inevitably arise as 
more Vermonters 
move online. A Broadband Corps could address these gaps through organizing volunteers 
through the CUDs and providing direct service to Vermonters to make sure as many as possible 
are connected quickly.
 
We recommend the creation of a Broadba
nd Corps in order to: (1) Assist with infrastructure and 
service deployment; (2) Perform outreach, and direct technical support to Vermonters becoming 
familiar with their broadband connections and devices; and (3) Provide high touch support to 
ensure low
-
i
ncome Vermonters take advantage of broadband support programs.
 
If the Corps is 
successful in connecting Vermonters rapidly, we recommend in the Spring that Corps members 
spend available time on pole surveys of towns on behalf of CUDs and thereby advance th
eir work 
toward deploying fiber. 
 
As an illustration of what is possible, this Report describes a Broadband Corps structure that 
combines regionally assigned Corps members with a statewide installation team. Corps members 
could be assigned to Regional Plan
ning Commission regions and could work closely with RPCs 
and/or CUDs if desired, with
 
centralized,
 
statewide management. We recommend at least 22 
regional corps members (two for each RPC region), and at least 20 statewide Corps members. 
 
While a Corps coul
d be put together quickly to get started as early as December, it is likely such 
a team would be focused on executing for a six
-
month period, for a budget of approximately $1.3 
million, including staffing and equipment.

Survey of Vermont Residences and Bus
inesses
 
The project team

in consultation with key
 
State 
stakeholders

conducted an online business 
survey and online residential survey over the course of three weeks, and commissioned a 
residential phone survey
 
(which is ongoing, as of the writing of this 
report)
. 
 
The online residential survey illuminated important aspects of changing customer behavior due 
to the pandemic in terms of use of the internet and demand for access

and, importantly, a 
severe lack of usage of low
-
cost broadband programs available 
to low
-
income residents. 
 
2.1
 
Residential Survey 
Methodology 
 
The online residential survey ultimately secured 
more than 
4,000 responses from Vermonters, 

through organic 
and paid promotions, including a press release from 

Public Service 
(
PSD
);
 
requests made to town administrators, librarians,
 
State 
legislators and other 
stakeholders to post the survey on town listservs
;
 
social media promotion from a range of 
entities
;
 
paid Front Porch Forum advertisements
;
 
outreach via 
Communications Union Districts 
(
CUD
)
, and more. 
 
The survey responses 
(presented in full in Appendix A) 
were weighted based on the age of the 
respondent a
nd region. Since older persons are more likely to respond to surveys than younger 
persons, the age
-
weighting corrects for the potential bias based on the age of the respondent. In 
this manner, the results more closely reflect the opinions of 
each c

adult population.
 
The 
figures below summarize the sample distribution by county and by age.

Most respondents (96
 
percent
) reported having internet access, including 79 percent who have 
both home internet service and a cellular/mobile telephone service with internet (smartphone). 
The high saturation of internet access would be expected in an online survey. 
 
Comcast Xfinity a
nd Consolidated Communications (CCI) are the leading internet service 
providers
 
(ISP)
 
used according to our surveys responses. Three in 10 respondents subscribe to 
Comcast Xfinity, and three in 10 subscribe to CCI. Other ISPs comprise much smaller shares o
f the 
market statewide but may represent larger shares in some individual counties. Further detail on 
companies used by respondents are provided in the body of the report. The figure below shows 
the sample size distribution by primary internet service prov
ider.

use of the internet and access points to the internet, and importantly, a severe lack 
of usage of 
low
-
cost broadband 
programs 
available to low
-
income residents
. The following are key findings:
 

 
5
 
percent of all respondents and 
9
 
percent of low
-
income households (earning less than 
$25,000 per year) only use a smartphone for home 
internet access.
 
This may limit their 
ability to fully utilize online services at home.
 

 
Residents may be significantly underutilizing existing broadband subsidy programs. 
Only one percent of all Comcast subscribers, and 10 percent of low
-
income subscribers
, 
participate in the Comcast Internet Essentials program. Another 59 percent of low
-
income subscribers were unaware of the program, and 15 percent attempted to enroll 
but were declined.
 

 
Most (99 percent) respondents access the internet from any location, i
ncluding a range 
of locations outside the home.
 
However, use of the internet outside of the home has 
declined significantly during the Covid
-
19 pandemic.
 

 
Most respondents are unaware of 
the State

s
 
Union 
Districts. 
Three in 10 re
spondents said they are aware of CUDs as a way to improve 
broadband access in unserved areas, while 59 percent are unaware and 11 percent are 
unsure.
 

 
Public Wi
-
Fi access may not be adequate.
 
Nearly one
-
half of respondents (4
5 percent
) 
are aware of public W
i
-
Fi hotspot locations near their home, but just eight percent said 
that hotspot access is adequate in the area. Another 43 percent were unsure.
 

 
Most respondents use search engines to learn about availability of internet service.
 
Two
-
thirds named search en
gines as the leading source of information to learn about 
available service options, and seven in 10 named search engines as the top source for 
learning how to use the internet more effectively.

19 Impacts on Broadband Use
 
Respondents reported incre
ased use of and demand for broadband services during the Covid

19 
pandemic. They are utilizing the internet more at home and less often outside the home, as may 
be expected, and they are engaged in more online activities for work, school, and entertainment
.
 
The following are key findings:
 

 
Daily use of home internet services at various times has increased during the 
pandemic
. Prior to the Covid
-
19 pandemic, just over one
-
half of respondents made 
daily use of the internet mid
-
morning or early afternoon, compa
red with 
approximately nine in 10 respondents during the pandemic. Four in 10 households

have at least three members online during peak usage times during the Covid
-
19 
pandemic.
 

 
Use of internet services outside of the home has declined significantly during
 
the 
Covid
-
19 pandemic.
 
Use of the internet in key areas decreased significantly when 
comparing
 
figures pre
-
Covid and during
-
Covid, including in work settings (7
9 percent
 
vs. 5
6 percent
), private businesses (6

vs. 2
7 percent
), schools or colleges 
(3

percent
 
vs. 2
0 percent
), and public buildings (3
7 percent
 
vs. 1
8 percent
).
 

 
Engagement in online activities has increased significantly during the Covid
-
19 
pandemic.
 
Use of the internet for telemedicine or medical appointments (1
9 percent
 
vs. 7
5 
percent
) and for civic engagement (3
3 percent
 
vs. 7
4 percent
) increased 
substantially from pre
-
pandemic to during
-
pandemic, although some of the use is at 
a monthly or less than monthly basis. Additionally, 62 percent of respondents use the 
internet for te
leworking on a daily basis, compared with 21 percent of respondents 
before the pandemic.
 

 
Satisfaction with internet service aspects has decreased during the pandemic, 
particularly for speed and reliability of service. 
More than one
-
half of respondents 
are 
not at all satisfied (approximately one
-
third) or are only slightly satisfied 
(approximately one
-
fifth) with connection speed and reliability during the pandemic.
 

 
Many respondents have experienced some challenge with accessing telehealth or 
an online medic
al appointment during the pandemic.
 
Specifically, four in 10 
respondents experienced an issue (e.g. having to switch from video to audio only), 
while three in 10 have not had a medical appointment and another three in 10 did not 
respond or had no issue.
 

 
Mo
st households with children have internet access, but it may not be sufficient for 
some families.
 
Most respondents disagreed that their children have to do homework 
or distance learn at various locations outside the home (although 13 percent agreed 
or stro
ngly agreed that their children cannot complete their homework or cannot 
distance learn because they do not have access to the internet at home.) However, 
four in 10 respondents strongly disagreed that their home internet connection is 
adequate for their o

online.
 
Sixteen percent of all respondents consumed public, educational, or governmental (PEG) TV 
content during the Covid

Almost all businesses have internet access
.
 
Leading types of primary internet service 
include cable modem (35 percent), DSL (27 percent), and fiber (15 percent). One
-
half (50 
percent) of businesses do not ha
ve a backup or secondary internet connection, and 32 
percent have a cellular/mobile connection as their backup or secondary internet 
connection.
 

 
The most utilized connectivity services were internet and telephone.
 
Most (99 percent) 
reported having internet
 
access at their primary business location, while 75 percent have 
telephone service, 61 percent have cellular data service, and 54 percent have 
videoconferencing service.
 

 
Almost all (99
 
percent
) businesses have personal computers.
 
Specifically, 65 percent 
of 
businesses have 1

but willingness drops considerably at higher price points
.
 
Just eight percent of 
businesses would be extremely willing to pay $250 per month for very fast internet service, 
but 22 percent would be extremely will
ing to purchase carrier

grade Ethernet transport and 
internet access service at this price point. Businesses would be not at all likely to slightly 
likely to pay more than $250 per month for carrier

Covid
-
19 Impacts on Broadband Use
 
Business
es are relying more on remote work during the pandemic and at the same time are 
reporting some inadequacies in their broadband internet service, particularly with speed and 
reliability of service.
 
The following are key findings:
 

 
Businesses report 
their internet service being slower during the pandemic
. Before the 
Covid
-
19 pandemic, more than four in 10 respondents (42
 
percent
) thought their internet 
connection speed was fast enough for their needs, dropping to 35 percent during the 
Covid
-
19 pandemi
c. Only 15
 
percent
 
thought their internet connection speed was very 
slow and would like to be connected at much higher speeds before the pandemic, while 
during the pandemic this number increased to 26
 
percent
.
 

 
Satisfaction with internet connection speed an
d reliability has dropped somewhat 
during the pandemic.

percent
 
during the 
pandemic.
 

 
Businesses are making more use of online platforms to sell goods or services or to 
engage in online marketing
 
and promotions during the pandemic.
 
The percentage of 
businesses that exclusively use online platforms to sell goods or services or to engage in 
online marketing and promotions has increased from six percent before the Covid
-
19 
pandemic to 15 percent duri
ng the pandemic.
 

 
The percent of time that employees work remotely has increased during the pandemic.
 
Specifically, one
-
third of employees now telework 75
-
100 percent of the time, compared 
with 11 percent of employees before the pandemic.
 

 
The percentage of 
employees working remotely is expected to increase after the Covid
-
19 pandemic.
 
More than four in 10 (42
 
percent
) businesses said they did not have a work 
remote option prior to the pandemic, while 29 percent said they do not plan to have one 
after the pan
demic and seven percent are undecided. One
-
fifth of business plan to have 
a fully remote work option for some or all employees after the pandemic, compared with 
13 percent during the pandemic.
 

 
Many businesses said that most or all of their employees (75
-
10
0
 
percent
) experienced 
issues due to inadequate broadband service during the pandemic
. For example, one
-
third of businesses said that all or most of their employees experienced delays in 
uploading or downloading content. More than one
-
half of businesses sa

Healthcare and Telehealth in Vermont
 
Telehealth usage has dramatically increased in 
the State
 
of Vermont due to the 
Covid
-
19 
pandemic, and with that, more Vermonters are reporting challenges with connectivity related to 
healthcare appointments. According to our 
online 
residential survey, 75
 
percent
 
of respondents 
have used telehealth services duri
ng the pandemic, and 
four
 
in 10 experienced technical 
difficulties or challenges 
related 
to connectivity. 
 
The growth in telehealth usage is a direct result of the pandemic and the desire to avoid in
-
person 
hospital visits; however, it could not have happened were 
it 
not for a range of
 
State 
and federal 
regulatory waivers and changes, including the waiver of pl
atforms from being HIPAA compliant
;
14
 
the expansion of telehealth by 
the 
U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
(
CMS
)
 
through 
section 
1135 
w
aiver
s
 
that allow 
a range of medical visits to be reimbursed by Medicare
;
15
 
and 
the temporary allowance of au
dio
-
only telehealth appoint
ment
s to be reimbursed by Medicaid 
at 
the State
 
level.
16
17
 
 
Though it is unclear whether these regulatory changes will be made permanent 
(thus 
enabling 
continued heightened use of telehealth
)
 
or allowed to expire
, the use of telehealth has provided 
a range of benefits, including the reduction 
of 
travel burdens
 
and miles driven
, the elimination 
of wait times 
(
especially in indoor, shared spaces
)
, and a reduction in 
missed appointments
, 
especially for certain specia
lties.

Federally Qualified Health Centers 
(

)
 
serve 
about a third of the Vermont 
population and saw a spike in telehe
alth visits 
in April
. 
As patients have been able to return for 
in
-
person care, the number of telehealth appointments has declined
 
to about 10 percent of 
weekly appointments. However
, the percent
age
 
of telehealth delivered as video visits 
as 
compared to
 
telephone visits has increased

implying that more residents are relying on their 
home broadband connections or smartphones for telehealth
. 
 
Dartmouth
-
Hitchcock Medical Center reported that 
pre
-
Covid
, 
offices were delivering about 10 
outpatient video visits per day, split about 50/50 between patients at home and patients at 
another clinical facility closer to their home.
 
In mid
-
April, 
DHMC 
hit a high of 2
,
600 telehealth 
appointments per day, including b
oth video and telephone appointments.
 
After an initial spike in telehealth usage in March and April, healthcare providers saw a slow 
decline of telehealth appointments, especially as patients return
ed
 
to in
-
office appointments for 
in
-
person needs like flu 
shots, immunizations, and testing that was delayed from earlier in the 
year. Nationally, the trend is similar, with telemedicine visits averaging around 6
 
percent
 
of the 
total weekly visits.
18
 
However, rising case numbers in Vermont may cause telehealth us
age to 
rise
 
again

as residents who have sufficient 
telecommunications
 
connectivity request telehealth 
visits, and as healthcare providers 
require virtual appointments whenever feasible as a way to 
limit exposure
. 
 
As telehealth appointments have increased 
in the last six months, providers have seen significant 
variability in telehealth usage by 
specialty
. Nationally, behavioral health telehealth usage remains 
high as the pandemic continues
,
 
whereas surgical 
specialties
 
have little to no usage of 
telemedicine. Additionally, telehealth has been adopted more widely in specific areas of care 
management, particularly in chronic care management and mental health services. OneCare 
Vermont reported that 
in a survey it conducted
, 
Vermont 
healthcare 
providers responded that 
the top four telehealth services they plan to continue post
-
pandemic are chronic management, 
mental health services, medication management, and non
-
urgent acute visits.
 
Though advocates 
do not 
anticipate telehe
alth increasing the number of patients that can be 
served in a given amount of time because practices

 
implementation is still at the stage where 
it 
 
18
 

isits is slowly declining from its April peak. But it continues to be 
well above the pre pandemic baseline of very few telemedicine visits

Lastly, it is important to note that FQHCs found that there is not a correlation between telehealth 
usage with 

broadband coverage or type
 
(though clearly a patient requires reli
able and 
sufficient broadband access to be able to consider a telehealth visit)
. Telehealth usage is 
influenced by many factors

including:

Though audio
-
onl
y telehealth visits are widely used, lack of broadband access is cited as a major 
barrier to effective telehealth appointments in 
the State
.
 
According to 
a 
OneCare 
Vermont 
survey, over 75
 
percent
 
of providers reported insufficient broadband access as a barrier for 
patients to participate in telehealth services. Providers routinely experience appointments where 
they are required to switch to audio
-
only to complete providing care. 
Though audio
-
only 
appointments may make telehealth services available to more people, some providers, like 
DHMC, believe that video
-
enabled telehealth appointments provide for better outcomes. 
 
UVM Health Network provided mobile hotspots to senior living centers to allow fo
r telehealth 
appointments where broadband connectivity was unable to meet remote care needs. By 
providing mobile hotspots to boost connectivity, UVM also eliminated unnecessary exposure for 
both patients and providers.
 
Another pilot to provide short

needs

Department of Health for the

State
. The pilot was not able to meet the demand of all requested devices due to financial 
constraints and a limited ti
meline. Further, VPQHC identified some applicants as ineligible for the

In addition to a lack of broadband access, technical support and digital literacy were also a large 
barrier 
to effective telehealth. In March 2020, OneCare
 
Vermont and Vermont Medical Society 
each completed a survey of Vermont providers to assess the transition to telehealth where both 
surveys received responses indicating that appointments take longer due to te
chnical issues from 
patient/provider knowledge and broadband issues.
19
 
55.
7 percent
 
of providers who took their 

service.
20
 
Nearly half of the respondents in t
he OneCare Vermont survey stated that they had 
appointed a dedicated employee in their office to educate and assist patients in telemedicine. 
Relatedly, we heard from several interviewees that clinical teams are spending too much time on 
technical issues w
ith the patients, shortening appointment time for health related discussion and 
limiting the amount of patients providers are able to serve.
 
In some cases, 
Covid
-
19 has also created the need for practices to bring on additional staff. For 
example, UVM Heal
th Network increased staff who participated in telehealth delivery from 50 
providers to 1
,
600 since March.
 
This increase in staffing clearly indicates the impact of the 
pandemic on demand for telehealth, and implies a likely future baseline of telehealth d
emand 
that exceeds the pre
-
Covid levels.
 
A lack of widespread residential broadband also impacts medical staff and healthcare providers. 
A key concern of providers in 
the State
 
is that when providers are exposed or test positive for 
Covid
-
19, they are required to quarantine for 10 days, which can leave offices short
-
staffed. The 
potential for a 
Covid
 
surge in the winter has heightened the fear that hospital resiliency is 
thus 
limited to some degree by 
lack of universal 
residential broadban
d access. By the same token, if 
hospitals themselves do not have systems in place to perform telehealth appointments, they are 
at a disadvantage during the pandemic, and potentially afterwards as telehealth takes on new 
prominence in our healthcare system.
 
 
The field of telehealth is evolving quickly. Data and metrics about effectiveness are still being 
studied, and the techniques needed to make appointments as efficient as possible are still being 
developed.
 
Given the short transition timeline due to the urgency of the pandemic, telehealth 
services have worked considerably well for 
Vermonters who 
have strong
-
enough broadband 
service to access it and available devices to use
. The 
health, safety, and environment
al benefits 
to 
the State
 
have been demonstrated
, and 
more Vermonters are using telehealth than ever 
before

but
, the benefits of telehealth 
(now and in the future) 
can only truly be captured by a 
connected, digitally trained population.

Telework
 
The shift t
o telework is one of the most pronounced impacts of the pandemic, and will have a 
lasting impact on how large segments of the population work even after the recovery. 
Reliable 

work during the 
pandemic and will continue to be required post

remotely

to 60

Many 
large companies (e.
g.,
 
Zillow, Twitter) have 
declared that distributed work will be made permanent and the 
applications 
market has 
exploded with tools to facilitate distributed collaboration. 
 

 
Most jobs in tourism, 
manufacturing, agriculture
,
 
and construction need to be done in person
.
 
As in 
most rural parts of 
the country, 

employment mix makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of 
pandemic
-
related shutdowns.
 
Vermont

 
unemployment soar
ed
 
in the spring of 2020 
(though 
there has been a rebound over the 
p
ast six months
)
.
 
 
Part of the reason the unemployment rate is not 
currently 
higher is that Vermont appears to 
have also benefited from the move to remote work, with evide
nce of an influx of people seeking 
refuge from cities (on a temporary or part
-
time basis) who brought their jobs with them.
 
This 
trend is dependent on the availability of residential broadband services. 
The Agency of 
Commerce and Community Development cite
d research from UVM that anticipates that of the 
new arrivals in Vermont, many of whom are currently working remotely, 
one
-
third 
will stay 
permanently
 
(and will presumably continue to require broadband service)
, 
one
-
third 
will leave 
after the pandemic is o
ver, and another third are undecided.
22
 
Vermonters also saw a significant shift to online work.
 
Our online survey showed that 62
 
percent 
of respondents use the internet for teleworking on a daily basis, compared with 21 percent of 
respondents stating they 
teleworked on a daily basis before the pandemic.
 
This shows a huge 
spike in demand for broadband as a result of Covid

a spike that will continue to the extent that 
residents continue to telework post
-
Covid.
 
Respondents to the business survey also saw 
signi
ficant shifts in their employees working from home and the phone survey 
found 
that a large 
number of people who are not deemed served are attempting to work from home with deeply 
inadequate connection speeds or needing to find publicly available connectivi

Understandably, this movement to remote work has put unprecedented value on access to 
residential broadband

and on the quality of that service
.
 
The online residential survey 
results 
suggest deepening dissatisfaction with broadband speeds as more people att
empt to work from 
home. Not only does this reinforce the need for remote workers who are struggling to have

passable connectivity as soon as possible, it reinforces the need for Vermont to move to a 
100/100 statewide solution.
 
 
Vermonters have responded to
 
the remote work mandates as directed by the governor

and 
employers have been working hard to develop new mechanisms for continuing operations in a 
remote work environment. Clearly these efforts have been thwarted by inadequate residential 
broadband speeds
 
in some areas
, even from those who are considered served. The move to 
remote work has the opportunity to benefit Vermont 
as 
more people 
from out of state 
seek a 

other benefits
, yet regions with poor broadband connectivity wil
l 
be left out of this potential migration.
 
 
3.3
 
Remote Learning 
 
Clearly, connectivity challenges are continuing to present challenges for educators despite best 
efforts to adjust to the realities of the pandemic. Disadvantaged students whose parents are less 
likely to be able to afford broadband connections and those without broadband infrastructure 
are now at an even greater risk of falling behind. Some school districts have clearly made 
attempts at accommodating many of their students, but unlike other state
s, Vermont has not 
taken a comprehensive statewide approach to address the problem. 
 
Superintendents who responded to a survey (described in detail below) overwhelmingly 
expressed that expanded residential high
-
speed internet is needed to facilitate online
 
learning. 


 
Because of the pandemic, c
hildren across 
the State
 
spent the fall 2020 semester

and most of 
the 
earlier 
spring semester
, after about mid
-
March

in 
a learning environment unlike any other.
 
The operations of Vermont schools are decided on a school
-
by
-
school basis, and the majority 

-
person teachi
ng and some remote learning, to 
minimize the 
Covid
-
19 
transmission risks to children, teachers, and families.
 
This environment is 
challenging, and though schools and teachers are adapting curricul
a
 
and teaching strategies to 
provide the best learning envir
onment they can, 
many 
students are struggling with remote 
learning due to inadequate residential broadband internet, especially 
because 
online learning 
often 
uses broadband
-
intensive applications like Zoom. 
 
When interviewed, 
representatives of 
the Vermont
 
Agency 
of Education 
(AOE) 
emphasized that 
it is 
clear that many families are struggling with broadband, but it is not always apparent whether 
the underlying issue is affordability or access to infrastructure.
 
Nearly every town has some areas 
that are serv
ed and some unserved with broadband, and there are low
-
income families in all 
Vermont communities.

The 
A
OE also reported that the shift to online learning has caused a large increase in workload 
for school district employees. Technology directors are spen
ding time helping students navigate 
computer and other technical issues, teachers are having to create multiple lesson plans to be 
taught online and in
-


 
operate entirely online.
 
The 
AOE 
also reported that the 
Vermont Virtual Learning Cooperative, which allows students to take online classes from other 
schools, now supports a record 11,000 students

all of whom depend on broadband 
connections
.
23
 
 
Though som
e ISPs with close relationships to the community

like Waitsfield Champlain Valley 
Telecom

have worked with schools to connect all students who need broadband, other school 
districts have been cautious about any sharing of student data, and the 
AOE 
has echo
ed concerns 
surrounding privacy of student data given the quick transition to online learning. An additional 
privacy concern is that public Wi
-
Fi networks, by their nature, are less secure
;
 
a number of 
students without broadband at home are using 
these net
works 
to access classes and homework. 
 
The project team sent a survey to 52 superintendents whose email addresses were available 
online to determine how school districts are adjusting to the 
Covid
-
19 pandemic and what gaps 
still remain
;
 
32 superintendents 
from 11 counties completed the survey, representing over half 
of superintendents (there are 54 supervisory unions in 
the State
).
 
Complete results are presented 
in Appendix C.
 
Importantly, it was clear that schools were working hard to ensure 
students had access to 
broadband by expanding Wi
-
Fi 
coverage 
in school parking lots, distributing laptops and hotspots, 
and working with the Department of Public Service to identify households that cannot access 
broadband infrastructure.
 
Among the survey f
indings are the following:
 

 
9
4 percent
 
of superintendents said their school districts surveyed their students to 
determine which students have access to broadband at home.
 

 
7
8 percent

identifying households with K

It is less common for schools to provide student
s equipment to connect to the internet, 
such as portable Wi

Fi hotspots, with 5
3 percent
 
of superintendents reporting their 
district did so. Portable hotspots rely on cellular service, which is poor in much of 
the

program or promoted a program with an Internet Service Provider to bring low

.
 
 
That being said, connectivity issues were far from solved by what schools were able to do, 
and 
lack of broadband access among some students 
had a major impact on school operations 
throughout the year

eds. Before

The project team sent a town administrator survey to 205 town managers, mayors, 
administrators, selectboard chairs, and other local officials across 
the State
; email addresses

A total of 
41 municipal l

Vermont is a very civically engaged state, and widespread participatory democracy has served 
the State
 
well for years, ensuring good faith and cooperative and collaborative governan
ce of our 
cities, towns, and state. Indeed, broadband availability during the pandemic seems to have 
enabled even more civic participation than before. Whereas 3
3 percent
 
of survey respondents 
reported participating in civic engagement at least monthly bef
ore the pandemic, over 5
0 percent
 
report 
participating 
now. With the fast approach of Town Meeting Day next year, it is important 
to note that just as a lack of connection is a barrier to equity for schoolchildren participating in 
distance learning, it als
o can present an equity issue for Vermonters participating in local 
government.

Overview of Service Based on State Broadband Mapping and Testing
 
The State Department of Public Service has compiled a rich s
et of broadband maps providing the 
level of wired broadband service available at each address in 
the State
, as well as wireless service 
areas based on drive tests on major State roads. The map and the accompanying drive tests and 
resources are among the most comprehensive sets of information compiled by any state and 
provide a starting point to assessing and a
ddressing 
the State

 
Unlike 
databases produced by the Federal Communications Commission and others that work on the 

addresses are claimed t
o be served by a service provider, 
the State

and accompanying materials provide the wired broadband service at each address from 
the 
State

-
911 database.
 
The map fits the existing service into categories of 100/100 Mbps servi
ce, 
25/3 Mbps service, 10/1 Mbps, 4/1 Mbps and underserved.
 
The broadband map also provides 
the opportunity to comment on the service at each address, to correct information and to 
provide more background about other aspects of the broadband service or nee
ds at the address.
 
 
Because the wireless drive test data was taken in 2018 and was measured only on major roads, 
the information from those tests is more impressionistic.
 
Yet it is still a useful complement to the 
 Covid

wired data and, accompanied by further inf
ormation from subsequent drive tests in various parts 
of 
the State
 
as well as further analysis based on tower locations, provides a starting point for 
understanding both wired and wireless coverage.
 
Based on the interactive broadband map, approximately 61,
000 premises, or 
about 
20 percent 
of the total, do not receive at least 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload
 
speeds

the 
current 
definition of broadband by the FCC.
 
 
Households and businesses not receiving 25/3 service will likely have challenges with stable 
and 
consistent access 
to 
the following
 
applications
, especially when 

broadband 
connection 
is used by more than one person at a time:
 

 
Interactive video as part of Zoom, Teams
,
 
or other tools commonly used for distance 
learning
 

 
Access to data resour
ces such as maps and stored videos (YouTube, etc.)
 

 
Access to resources in a work or learning environment based in the cloud
 

 
Sharing and backup of files in a storage and application environment such as Google
 
Docs, 
Drop
b
ox or OneDrive
 

 
Medical appointments i
ncluding video, medical charts
,
 
and rudimentary testing
 
Moreover, households and businesses who have bandwidth
-


extremely s
paring in their use, needing to ration bandwidth between work needs, classroom 
learning by children, and entertainment.
 
Even wireless and satellite services which claim to be 

rs who hit their 
bandwidth caps, resulting in inability to effectively use video resources until the following month 
billing period, and/or may pay significant overage charges.
 
Therefore we identify the 61,000 premises without access to wireline broadband 
over 25/3 to be 
at immediate connectivity risk during the pandemic, and we identify strategies targeted at these 
homes and businesses.
 
The 61,000 premises that do not receive 25/3, not including premises set to be served by the 
Emergency Connectivity Initi
ative, are distributed throughout 
the State
, which poses significant 
and varied challenges for both short
-
term and long
-
term connectivity goals. 
 
However, there are some clear trends.
 
Those served by 25/3 or 100/100 tend to be in the cities 
and 
towns.
 
Those without the service are often in a perimeter area around a town or in an 
outlying area.
 
The following figure 
provides a typical example.

: Sample Coverage Map
 
 
Because most of the 25/3 service is provided by cable broadband companies (Comcast, Charter) 
the distribution is mostly historical, due to the fact that cable operators were only required to 
build to areas up to a particular density in their franchise agre
ements. The following is a map of 
unserved premises in Vermont. This data was collected by 
the State
 
in 2019 and is current as of 
that date, however, premises funded by the Emergency Connectivity Initiative have been 
removed.

of 
the State
; due to the hills, mountains, and trees, almost no town is completely covered by 
service, though very few towns 
are also wholly unserved. The following is a map of drive

test 
data performed on major roads in 2018, with additional data collected by volunteers in 2020. 
 
Figure 
16
: Drive Test Routes
 
 
 
In addition to the drive
-
test data, we hav
e mapped locations of cell provider antenna sites in 
Vermont used by one or more providers. The infrastructure ranges from latticed towers to 

of the infrastr
ucture and surrounding topography will dictate how far service reaches; however 
due to time constraints, we have estimated that good service can be provided to premises up to 
three miles away from the radios. This is a crude estimate that is an average; wi
th good height 
and lines of sight, service could potentially extend for five or more miles. Installed low and in a 
valley or obstructed by trees, service might be limited to a mile.

Even advanced RF propagation estimates may not be able to predict how str
ong a signal is at a 
particular premise. Any first responder who knows the back roads of 
the State
 
would tell you that 
propagation maps published by providers themselves largely overstate the range of their signal
.
 
However, our high
-
level analysis based on
 
the drive test maps and the tower sites, indicates that 
there may sufficient coverage over many parts not served by 25/3 with wired services, to provide 
broadband using mobile service to many underserved Vermonters

and that because provide 
them with mobil
e service does not require new construction or new towers, they can receive 
service in time to address their needs during the pandemic.
 
 
An even larger number of the
 
remaining un
served
 
and underserved premises in 
the State
 
could 
be served if the signal wer
e augmented by a rooftop signal booster. We note again the difficulty 
in precisely predicting the signal levels and capacity of wireless networks, and emphasize that it 
will need to examine individual cases more closely, which may be the responsibility of 
the 
proposed

orps discussed in more detail

4.1.2
 
Status Reported by Providers
 
In interviews, internet service providers across 
the State
 
reported increases in bandwidth usage 
over the course of the epidemic, with a larger increase in upstream utilization. For example, 
Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom reported a 30 percent increase in bandwidth usage; 
AT&T reported that core network 
traffic increased 22 percent and that video conferencing 
increased 400 percent. ISPs also reported changes in peak utilization times: Peak internet usage 
used to be around 8pm; providers are finding now that peak usage occurs throughout the day as 
well as 
in the evening, as people are working and learning from home. 
 
Internet service providers reported that their networks were able to handle increased utilization, 
although in practice, certain types of networks become much more constrained with more usage. 
In particular, wireless technology and DSL based technology, have greater capacity constraints 
and are more likely to provide slow performance with many users on the network. In contrast to 
wireless and DSL, operators of fiber networks and cable networks r
eported no bandwidth 
constraints during the pandemic, despite increased bandwidth needs.
24
 
 
Wireless providers face similar constraints due to limitations of their technology and the 
spectrum. VTel reports that they manage capacity by limiting service to c
ustomers with adequate 
line of sight from the antenna to their home or business. They report that they do not like to 
hook up customers on their wireless 4G LTE network unless they are confident the customer can

get at least 10 Mbps download, because custo
mer satisfaction drops significantly at lower 
speeds. 
 
Several internet service providers interviewed said they saw an increase in requests for customer 
installations, and in some cases did not have enough technicians to meet the demand; for 
example, ECFib
er, First
L
ight, and Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom all expressed the need 
for more trained technicians. 
 
Prices for service in Vermont range by provider, but are not out of step with service costs in other 
areas (see 
A
ppendix 
F 
for comparison to o
ther states). Providers have also launched a range of 
programs to assist Vermonters who may be struggling financially due to the

Owned and Operated Systems
 
Operators of State telecommunications systems report their networks have functioned well 
during the 
Covid

y measures put in place 
have not impacted delivery of services. 
 
Many
 
State 
agencies successfully changed telecommunications protocols or operational 
protocols due to the pandemic

increasing the IT and network load to State agencies. The Agency 
of Natural 
Resources switched to a contact

pandemic. However, this has put 
the strain on the connection to employee home networks, and 
many
 
State 
employees working from home struggle with the same residential connectivity 
challenges as other employers in 
the State
. 
 
In interviews, employees at a range of
 
State 
agencies reported t
hat co
-
workers were struggling 
with reliable broadband at home. For example, one
 
State 
employee reported that a co
-
worker 
had trouble using CAD software at home, as CAD requires significant bandwidth. It is common 
for employees with poorer home connectivit
y to need to come into the office more often to do 
work, use office equipment, or communicate. 
 
Some
 
State 
telecommunication systems need upgrades or expanded capacity, although many of 
these needs predate the pandemic. First, the Agency of Transportation 
and Agency of Natural 
Resources have buildings in remote locations, which still struggle with connectivity. Cellular 
service is also an issue at many of these locations. In addition, libraries on the FiberConnect 
network are responsible for maintaining the
 
network electronics on location. Because of the age 
of the network but the need to use compatible systems, libraries buy electronics that are 
eight
 
or 
nine
 
years old, and report that it is becoming difficult to find equipment of that age. Upgrading 
the ne
twork to use newer equipment will cost about $250,000 but will be key to ensuring 
resiliency.
 
In addition to the needs of 
S
tate employees, as government services are increasingly offered 
online, many
 
State 
agencies are most concerned about making sure that
 
constituents who are 
not connected to the internet are not left out. 
Thirty

percent of town managers, town 
administrators, and selectboard chairs surveyed said that their constituents were having trouble

noted the need 
to make training materials compatible with smartphones, as some people 
they worked with had access to a smartphone but not a computer. 
 
In addition, the Unemployment Insurance system is operated online, with reminders to file claims 
and other information s
ent by email. As backup, there is an automated phone system that the 
Department of Labor uses to reach people without emails though. In general, most people filing 
for unemployment had access to a computer and the internet, and the 
Department of Labor 
addr
essed connectivity on a case
-
by
-
case basis (for example, filing by fax or in person). 
 
Based on our discussions with agencies, 
the S
tate has been able to serve its internal needs 
adequately. For example, the 911 system upgrade this year is slated to save 
t
he State
 
$1 million 

cloud is a desirable approach, as it will allow for more resiliency, security, alignment with industry 
standards, and

in the pandemic

help 
S
t
ate workers to more easily access work when outside 
of 
the State

The State
 
should keep in mind that the suite of technology solutions employed 
across agencies may become more complicated and network
-
intensive as functions migrate to 
the cloud, and m
aintaining secure and resilient connections that employees can access from 
residences is extremely important, as is maintaining top
-
tier cybersecurity protocols. 
 
Though 40 libraries are on the FiberConnect network, some libraries are being served by fiber
 
networks outside of 
the State

fiber access through the e
-
rate program, and some do not. These unserved institutions, as well 
as many unserved 
Agency of Transportation 
and 
Agency of Natural Resources 
sites, will 
potentially only be served when 
the State
 
achieves its goal of 100/100 Mbps service across 
the 
State
. By supporting the Communication Union Districts and their deployment, 
the State
 
will also 
quickly be able to bring
 
sufficiently fast and reliable service to these unserved institutions, whose 
subscription to services as anchor customers can potentially provide modest revenue to the 
emerging networks. 
 
We recommend that
 
connectivity on a

the State in responding to, and recovering from, the pandemic. We concluded that strategies 
related to neutral host infrastructure are long

strategies be considered in the context of a long
-
term, comprehensive broadband plan. At the 
same time, we offer these high
-
level observations.
 
4.3.1
 
Shared Infrast
ructure
 
One opportunity to increase the options for broadband to underserved and unserved 
Vermonters in time to assist during the pandemic is to continue and expand the placement of 
wireless broadband in and around government and community anchor locations
. All stakeholders 
with infrastructure of this nature

from 
l
ibrarians to the 
Agency of Transportation
, 
Agency of 
Natural Resources
, and others

expressed interest in making their facilities available if needed. 
Should the pandemic worsen in winter months, w
e recommend that entities with fiber or cable 
connections to large buildings consider if there is a safe way to allow individuals to work and 
learn inside, physically distanced, to alleviate the number of people currently connecting from 
parking lots. This
 
could be considered for underused town halls, heated 
Agency of Transportation 
garages, or other similar buildings. 
 
Because of the needed 
Covid
-
19
 
precautions, however, this must be done with great caution; 
and to not burden existing employees, the operat
ion of facilities like this could be done by the 
proposed

barriers, and sanitizing surfaces. 
 
4.3.2
 
Open Access and Neutral Host Wireless
 
Open acc
ess networking is a model where the physical infrastructure is built and operated for 
the benefit of multiple service providers who can access the network on a non
-
discriminatory 
basis and provide competitive services.

suitability of both approaches for areas which are unserved or underserved by wireless providers.
 
These are potential models in particular for areas where the cost to build and operate is 
sufficiently high that an individual wir
eless provider will not take the risk to build, or where 
construction is particularly challenging.
 
One example is the US

The main challenges with building and o
perating an open
-
access model in areas as rural as 
Vermont are in attracting partners to fund and build the network, and in finding service providers 
interested in setting up operations if they had only a portion of an already limited number of 
customers.
 
With regards to neutral
-
host wireless facilities, an illustrative experiment in Vermont was the 
small cell deployment done by CoverageCo to fix cell service gaps in 2016 and 2017. The project 
did not ultimately succeed for three primary reasons: 
 
1.
 
The first
 
radios deployed were along driving corridors, and usage was 5x less than 
anticipated due to Vermonters talking less while driving than the national average, and a 
moratorium on talking while driving enacted shortly after deployment
.
 
2.
 
Many initial radios we
re deployed using DSL as backhaul, which proved to be unreliable 
and insufficient, leading to poor customer experiences
.
 
3.
 
R
efusal 
by a telephone company 
to allow its subscribers to roam on the network 
decreased usage
.
 
The problems listed above resulted in the majority of deployments losing money every month; 
clearly, an unsustainable operation. 
 
The company pivoted their deployment strategy to focus on locations with cable or fiber 
backhaul, and in locations where the r
adios could serve residential clusters. This strategy relied 
on field organizing to find households, businesses, churches, and other entities willing to place a 
receiver on their structures; however, many were happy to do so to bring service to their 
neigh

Store in Strafford, Kedron Valley Inn in South Woodstock, and on the steeple of the Hartland UU 
Church. These sites became profitable; however, CoverageCo was not a
ble to pivot fast enough 
to install enough profitable sites to overcome the number of sites losing money month to month.

recommendations for changes to this system must be given careful consideration and are beyond 
the scope of this plan, especially considering
 
the time needed to design and adopt changes. 
 
The project team recommends two models be investigated in the next 10
-


 
In the former, 
the State
 
built and traded communications conduit, fiber
,
 
and co
mmunications 
circuits statewide. 
The 
s
tate
 
built an initial allotment of 600 fiber
-
miles as part of an initial 
infrastructure deployment centered around intelligent transportation systems on UDOT 
corridors. The 
s
tate publicized its existing routes and a wi
sh list of future routes for future needs. 
It established a master lease agreement with each entity seeking to build in UDOT right of way 
and engaged in mile
-
for
-
mile trades of its excess infrastructure to expand its own use to new 
areas built by other pro
viders, as well as making it possible for new providers to get a head start 
in their builds using the excess UDOT infrastructure in already
-
constructed routes. Trades are not 
required, however, and providers may also simply pay a fee for access to UDOT rig
hts
-
of
-
way.
 
New York City has identified three different zones, A, B, and C, based on broadband need. Fees 
for Right of Way access

in the case of New York, rent for access to City streetlights for small 
wireless facilities, can operate on a sliding scale. 
The fee is 3.5 times higher per month to operate 
a small cell in Midtown Manhattan than in an area with less service. 
 
Lastly, the Agency of Transportation notes that 
the State
 

The establishment of these provisions s
hould be considered in the next 10
-
year plan. While these 
are not concerns raised by providers, we note that the vast majority of deployments being aerial, 
pole space will likely become scarce, with providers needing to choose between expensive pole 
replac
ement and make ready, and underground construction. Considering the high cost of 
underground construction in rocky soils, it will make sense for 
the State
 
and municipalities to 
make potential excavators and broadband deployers aware of road expansion and i
mprovement 
projects, and for 
the State
 
to be aware of projects considered by other utilities, in order to build 
communications infrastructure or to notify excavators who may want to take the opportunity to 
build

especially in expensive routes in urban area
s, rocky soils and alongside limited access 
roads.

Emergency Communications Initiatives and Requirements
 
Through interviews with a range of emergency personnel and
 
State 
emergency management 
leadership, and review of the 2020 Statewide 
Communications Interoperability Plan (SCIP), the 
project team found that though emergency services were forced to react, adapt, and in some 
cases make contingency plans due to the pandemic, emergency communications and operations 
in Vermont have not been a
dversely impacted by the pandemic.

The e911 Board has six Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), which provides redundancy to 
the system. All six have continued to operate during the pandemic, and the e911 Board also 
created a back
-
up PSAP location in ca
se one needed to be closed down due to a 
Covid
-
19 
outbreak; the e911 Board plans to keep the back
-
up location after pandemic has subsided for 
additional redundancy. While the 911 system is operating well, there are ongoing concerns 
regarding customer educa
tion with regards to 911 communication, and interoperability with 
certain calling and texting mechanisms. For example, not all messaging apps and/or over

the

Wi

Fi calling apps work with 
the State

 
Further, 
the State
 
delayed the transition
 
to a next generation 911 system by several months due 
to travel restrictions and other 
Covid
-
related challenges; however, they had a fully functioning 
system in place they could continue to rely on, and when the transition ultimately happened in 
October, 
it went smoothly. 
 
The primary concerns of the e911 Board include spotty cell coverage in 
the State

a 
problem 
that clearly pre
-
dated the pandemic

and 
concerns regarding customer education. For example, 
not all text messaging apps work with 
the State

involved parties (not the least of which the apps themselves) to communicate their constraints 
to the pub
lic. 
 
Land Mobile Radio (LMR) is the primary means of communication for first responders in Vermont; 
this system is resilient and robust in all parts of 
the State
.
28
 
The LMR system has continued to 
function well during the 
Covid
-
19 pandemic. 
 
The Vermont C
ommunications System (VCOMM) is an alternate interoperable radio system that 
operates on the Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) bandwidths.
29
 
This 
system provides frequencies that can be used across service areas, regions and states; 
first 
responders that receive grant money through the Department of Homeland Security are required 
to put VHF and UHF channels on their radios, which ensures interoperability across state lines. 

) includes plans to promote the 
VCOMM system. There were no reported issues with the VCOMM system during the pandemic. 
 
Cellular broadband is also often used by first responders when available. Verizon is the cellular 
provider with the most coverage in 
the
 
State
, followed by AT&T, though coverage by the latter is 
increasing due to FirstNet deployments and roaming agreements AT&T has recently enacted with 
VTel. Still, locations with unreliable cell service remain a public safety concern for first 
responders,

however, first responders know their communities well and have always accounted for known 
gaps in service and planned ahead accordingly. 
 
The FirstNet network, currently bein
g deployed, should improve cellular coverage for all 
Vermonters, but will prioritize traffic from first responders. FirstNet originated as the National 

public safe
ty communications interoperability and was assigned spectrum for broadband 
wireless communications for first responders.
 
FirstNet issued a national request for proposals 
and selected AT&T to build and operate the network.
 
 
AT&T has use of the FirstNet publ
ic safety spectrum nationwide and is required to increase its 
coverage according to FirstNet specifications.
 
As a result, AT&T is expanding its service nationally 
and in Vermont, using the FirstNet spectrum and its other spectrum.
 
AT&T may use the spectrum
 
to serve its customers, but must provide priority and, if necessary, preemption to support first 
responders in an emergency.
 
 
The project team interviewed AT&T to understand their deployment in Vermont. AT&T has 
committed to deploying 36 FirstNet sites in
 
Vermont by the end of the first quarter of 2022 
(including six sites to be built for FirstNet by Great North Woods Wireless (GNWW)). So far, AT&T 
has deployed radios at 4 new sites in Vermont, as well as upgrades to 2 existing sites. By the end 
of the yea
r, AT&T projects they will deploy 8 additional sites and upgrade one more site, bringing 

the State
 
to 15.
 
FirstNet deployment has not been proceeding as quickly as some had hoped, although AT&T is 
still within the t
imeline allotted for deployment and will accelerate deployments in the next 2 
years to meet their deadline. One challenge identified is that many FirstNet deployments are in 
areas where there is no cellular coverage; deploying in these areas requires exten
ding utilities 
backhaul to a new cell tower, which takes more time and planning. AT&T said that in these 
situations, delays are increased by the fact that ISPs providing backhaul often do not want to 
begin planning backhaul deployment until the cell tower 

six months to the deployment process. Permitting for new towers can also be a challenge; 
additionally, AT&T cited deployment in certain areas such as the Green Mountain National Forest 
or 
the State
-
owned Green Mountai
n Reservoir. However, this tension is to be expected in a state 
with robust environmental concern and attention paid to environmental impacts, and the project 
team does not feel that assessing permitting processes was appropriate to do on an extremely 
acce
lerated project timeline. 
 
The decision to enroll in FirstNet will remain the jurisdiction of local public safety departments, 
as they understand their own territory best, however there are cost, redundancy, and 
interoperability benefits to the prioritizat
ion of a single system. AT&T allows first responders to

try out FirstNet enabled devices to determine if there is service free of charge, which will allow 
public safety departments to make an informed decision. 
 

 
the FirstNet network will likely still have gaps 
after being fully deployed. 
The State
 

and 
the State
 
should ensure that the next 10
-
year plan includes an assessment of how 
the State
 
can fill remai
ning gaps in service. 
 
The State
 
should expect everything that supports public safety communication ecosystems will 
expand, become more complicated, and more dependent on broadband.
 
For example,
 
an 
application that allows 911 callers to send photos of an i
njury to a 911 dispatcher, or even video 
call a 911 dispatcher, would have the potential to improve public safety 

 
but only where 
adequate coverage is available. While the appetite for adopting cutting edge applications varies 
by agency and department, th
ese applications will not even be possible without better cellular 
coverage. With 
the State

the State
 
has 
remained up to date and even ahead of the majority of other states in terms of sophistication 
of 
its system. 
 
It will also be necessary to bridge the LMR system with new cellular
-
based communications. The 

legacy LMR radios and digital radios that use 4G 
LTE; under P25, first responders can download 
an application that allows them to use their cell phone like two
-
way radio. While 
the State
 
police 
force is starting to implement this system, municipalities have not yet done so. Because 
the State
 
police work 
closely with local police departments, state police will wait until all or a majority of 
local departments are on board to begin using the P25 system. This is a prudent approach. 
 

Statewide Communication Interoperability Plan (
SCIP
)
 
provides a future vision which 
includes the FirstNet mobile broadband network assuming a more critical role in emergency 
communications.
 
The need to migrate public safety to broadband and FirstNet in particular 
means that public safety is now tethered to 
mobile broadband coverage and capacity.
 
Underserved areas for broadband are also underserved from the point of view of public safety 
communications, even if the traditional land
-
mobile radios systems serve the area

because 
LMR is no longer the sole infrast
ructure needed for emergency response.
 
Accelerating AT&T expansion will thus have the dual purpose of furthering broadband for the 
public as needed for 
Covid
 
and providing the emergency communications that responders need 
in the same area
 
One notable succe
ss described in the SCIP that has paid dividends during the pandemic is that 
Vermont is significantly ahead of most states in implementation of next

Among other many other functional benefits, this means that the State has

Noting the priority in the SCIP for FirstNet rollout

One step could be to address the 
claim by AT&T that fiber providers will not begin planning and design of backhaul until site is 
complete

and address a
ny technical and business issues with the fiber providers that are 
creating the delay.

Public, Educational and Government Access Television 
 
The 
Covid
-
19 pandemic has increased the difficulty of delivering PEG services, while also 
increasing the importance and urgency of those services. 
 
PEG stations have been tasked with providing crucial c
ommunications resources for Vermonters, 
including information on the pandemic, support for remote education, access to governmental 
affairs, and connections with other community events. Overall, viewership has been steady or 
increasing, and in many cases, 

increased significantly, with many stations reporting spikes in Facebook views, You
T
ube views, 
and Google website traffic during the pandemic months. For example, GNAT saw a 71.

TV saw a 7
5 percent
 
increase in quarterly web 
traffic from April
-
June 2020 compared to April
-
June 2019. 
 
At the same time, PEG stations face declining revenues in part due to decreases in cable franchise 
fees. They also face greater pressure on their existing technical capacities, as the growth in 
dem
and for coverage of an increasingly wide array of events is stretching staffs thin. Stations 
report spending increased time on digital management and training of local community members 
on digital technology. They also have had to adapt to health protocols
 
in the actual filming and 
production of events. 
 
Importantly, PEG stations have responded to the 
Covid
-
19 pandemic by providing critical content 
to meet community needs. PEG stations have provided:
 

 
Ongoing emergency management updates, including access to
 
government press 
conferences, related to the 
Covid

Production and technical support to stream and archive public meetings and events. This

PEG stations reported responding to the effects of the pandemic by conti
nuing to expand their 
virtual offerings and design hybrid public meetings and events. They are working to increase 
security, success, and transparency of these events, as the pandemic continues to change the 
way that video production can operate, and to ch
ange the way that video consumption is done. 
 
Lastly, as they continue to respond to this increased demand and shifting environment, PEG

commerce capabilities. Moving to e
-
commerce has 
become a necessity for businesses; even main street stores have discovered that they need an e

commerce pl
atform; businesses also need assistance in social media and building an online 
brand.
 
As a whole, this is a healthy evolution for businesses to make; however, doing so during a 
pandemic when traditional revenue sources are constrained is not ideal.
 
What is
 
clear is that the 
businesses that survive will likely make digital elements a long
-
term part of their operations.
 
An 
increase in digital literacy across 
the State
, and residential broadband, will allow the employees 
and employers of newly digital business
es better ability to continue operations and grow. 
 
The RDCs are providing valuable technical assistance to many businesses in Vermont, but they 
need additional resources in order to meet all the needs of Vermont businesses. RDCs have not 
been able to keep
 
up with the demand for this program; they are currently assisting a cohort of 
300 businesses, with 80 to 100 more businesses on waiting lists; the RDCs stopped advertising 
their program when they realized they would not be able to serve all the businesses
 
that had 
signed up, so the true demand for this program is likely even higher. 
 
Furthermore, while the current program will help businesses set up e
-
commerce programs, the 
RDC does not have capacity to then support businesses in maintaining those platform
s, and 
importantly, the RDCs have not had the funding to provide technical assistance regarding 
cybersecurity, which will become increasingly important as more functions migrate online. 
 
Finally, as many other stakeholders have reported, digital literacy i
s a big issue, and businesses 
could benefit from additional assistance training their employees on how to use video 
conferencing, online platforms, and digital work technologies.

At least one CUD worked to aggregate

as few constituents ultimately received LECAP grants. 
 
The CUDs also had an important role to play in th

CUDs have interprete

In response to the Covid

quickly 
launched several programs to 


working to 
connect Vermonters as fast as possible and assist t
hose struggling financially. In general, 
programs were beneficial and accomplished their stated goals

though, as with most programs 
executed so quickly, they would have been even more effective if PSD had 
additional resources
 
and time
.

Line Extension Cust
omer Assistance Program
 
The Line Extension Customer Assistance Program (LECAP) awarded $3,000 grants to subsidize the 
customer contribution, or 
contribution
-
in
-
aid
-
of
-
construction (
CIAC
), of a line extension.

Up to 
$500 
of that amount 
may be applied to s
ubsidize 
the cost of a 
customer drop beyond 300 feet. 
The consumer is responsible for any costs exceeding $3,000. 
 

experience, most line extension programs r
ely on the ISP applying for funding for specific 
projects, meaning line extension funding is driven by where ISPs desire to expand. In contrast, 
consumers apply for LECAP grants, meaning funding is allocated based on consumer demand. 
 
That being said, the LECAP model does put some burden on consumers, as they must apply with 
their ISP for a LECAP grant. Additionally, 
because a single line extension to serve multiple 
premises would decrease the cost for each individual applicant, residen
ts would benefit from 
coordinating with their neighbors

which could be challenging.
 
Under Vermont Public Utility Commission Rule 8.313(B), cable companies must extend service to 
customers within their franchise territory, but the cost of construction is sp
lit between the 
customer and the cable company
, with the cable company paying a larger share in more densely 
populated areas. The 
CIAC
 
is shared between all residents who commit to subscribing to cable 
television. The PSD provides an 
online calculator (
https://jscalc.io/calc/Z9n1nal1nku3VNP4
) 
to 
estimate the 
CIAC
 
per subscriber. The calculator estimates that the cost per subscriber for a 1
-
mile line extension, with a construction cost of $30,000 is:
 

 
$0
 
with 16 subscribers
 

 
$625 with 12 subscribers
 

 
$1,875 with 8 subscribers
 

 
$3,125 with 6 subscribers

LECAP is available to Vermonters who can demonstrate a

learning, te
lehealth
,
 
or telework, lack 25/

broadband internet service, and are near an existing 
cable video provider or other 
ISP
. If a service provider did not project that they could complete a 
requested line extension by the end of the year, the consumer making t
he request would not be 
eligible for a LECAP grant.
 
Consumers had to apply for a line extension with the service provider 
and
 
apply for the LECAP 
grant from the PSD. Applications were due September 15.
 
Some
 
ISPs, consumers, and community institutions 
express frustration with LECAP
. For example, 
the NEK CUD partnered with school districts to hold an educational seminar explaining
 
how their 
constituents could apply for LECAP, and also attempted to help organize neighbors to apply 
together, but ultimately felt that these efforts were in vain as few constituents were connected 
through the program. The roll
-
out of the program may have
 
also created high expectations 
among consumers, some of whom were eventually told they were not eligible or their line 
extension would cost significantly more than $3,000. ISPs felt they had to manage consumer 
expectations; for example, Comcast expressed 
that 
it
 
wished there was better communication 
about who was eligible
 
and
 
how they could apply.
 
 
Overall, 
LECAP is
 
a successful program, well designed and implemented quickly. The Department 
of Public Service stood up an innovative program driven by consume
r demands in an incredibly 
short timeframe. 
Particularly impressive is
 
how customer demand drove deployments, to ensure 
that line extensions were targeted to people who were going to use them.

Emergency Connectivity Initiative and Get Vermonters Connected
 
Now

The Emergency Connectivity Initiative and Get Vermonters Connected Now Initiative (GVCNI) 
awarded $12 million in three rounds to fund broadband deployment to locations without access 
to the internet with speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps. This p

The PSD administered these two
 
programs together, using one RFP and one list of priority and 
eligible locations. Providers must provide at least 500 MB of un

DSL providers must conduct a speed test at funded locations demonstrating that their service

not meet this requirement; if 1
5 percent
 
or more locations cannot provide 25/3 service, the 
provider will forfeit the entire grant. All funded projects must be c
ompleted by the end of the 
year.
 
The Emergency Connectivity Initiative and GVCNI have funded deployments that will connect 
9,771 locations: about 2,200 with fiber to the home, 271 with cable, and about 7,300 with 
wireless.

Collecting data to determine locations with remote learning, telework and telehealth needs was 
challenging. The Department of Public Service relied on school districts, CUDs, town 
governments, and other community institutions, many of which worked diligently to
 
help their 

region. For example, not all school districts provided data on which s
tudents had connectivity 
needs because of privacy concerns. Healthcare providers similarly had to be cautious of privacy 
laws.
 
 
In addition to assisting the Department of Public 
S
ervice in identifying priority locations, CUDs 
also had the right to object t
o any Emergency Connectivity Initiative and GVCNI grants within 
their footprints. 
M
any
 
ISPs did not appreciate this aspect of the initiative. The project team also 
interviewed several CUDs, and found that while they recognized that grants might hurt their 
future business case, CUDs understood the importance of improved connectivity in the s
hort 
term and approved most projects, especially projects that did not offer wired services. The CUDs 
the project team interviewed only rejected funding for projects that the CUDs felt would not 
appropriately serve their community, or would be clearly detr
imental to reaching the long
-
term 
goal of 100/100 service.
 
 
The Emergency Connectivity Initiative and GVCNI will connect nearly 10,000 previously unserved 
premises by the end of the year for a price of $1,200 per premise
s
.
 
Importantly, if CUDs are going 
to
 
continue to play a role in shaping the connectivity landscape of their regions, 
the State
 
and 
CUDs should collaboratively provide guidance, with public input from that region, as to what 
infrastructure and deployments should be prioritized.
 
For example, c
able line extensions in 
unserved pockets within already cabled towns are less likely to affect CUD plans, and yet are 
equally as helpful at connecting difficult
-
to
-
serve areas.
 
 
Lastly, additional assessment of the effectiveness of this program should be u
ndertaken after 
speed tests confirm that promised speeds have been delivered.

. These hotspots are an important resource Vermonters without access to

approve
d emergency funding for 65 additional hotspots; in October, the PSD approved funding 
for a third round of 50 RTO hotspots. The PSD has prioritized funding hotspots in locations

were 
also the most likely to say that their availability and access was inadequate.
 
 
The Department of Public Service ef

that these are critical to allowing people easy access to Wi

ensure as many Vermonters can connect to the internet from home as soon as possible. 
Completi
ng work or school from a car can be difficult, especially during the winter, and attending

Programs for Vermonters 
S
truggling 
F

The Department o
f Public Service also started programs to assist Vermonters who are 
struggling
 
financially due to the 
Covid

19 pandemic. First, the Vermont 
Covid

19 Arrearage Assistance 
Program 
provides eligible Vermont households and businesses with a grant to pay for 
past

balances for regulated utility bills; this program covers electric, landline telephone, Vermont Gas 
and private water companies, but not broadband internet.
 
The Department of Public Service also hosted a page on 
its
 
website of all the programs ISP
s have 
created to support Vermonters during this time.
 
 
Finally, the Department of Public Service created the Temporary Broadband Subsidy (TBS), which 
provides eligible households with a credit of up to $40 to assist with broadband internet costs; 
payments
 
can be applied retroactively to March 1. While the TBS is a generous program, its 
reach 
was unfortunately limited, perhaps by the effort required to receive the subsidy

of Public Service estimates that about 2,000 Vermonters took advantage
 
of the program, while 
the program had funding to assist up to 8,600 Vermonters.
 
 
The Temporary Broadband Subsidy could be improved by reducing friction for end

users (i.e.

titutions

nd 
potentially
 
promotion in coordination with other programs targeted to similar users.

Broadband Technology Sufficiency Standards in a Pandemic
 
To meet the challenge of connecting thousands of new users to broadband in a short period of 
time, 
it will be important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each technology to 
determine the best type of technology in a situation.
 
It is also important to understand which 
types of technologies can support very heavy use (that is, those that are m
ost scalable).
 
 
Where wireline networks are available, their technical characteristics mean that they will be able 
to support significant numbers of new connected households. This is especially true of fiber optic, 
cable broadband, and high
-
speed DSL conne
ctions (rated at 25/3 Mbps). The majority of students 
in 
Vermont
 
are in homes passed by a high
-
speed wireline technology, though many are not.
 
 
Where wireline networks are not available, adding many new users all at once could tax the 
wireless 
networks. This is the case for both fixed wireless service and mobile broadband (4G) 
service.
 
Wireless providers can provide maps and estimates of signal quality, which can provide 
an estimate.
 
However, even with this type of estimate, there will need to b
e flexibility in the 
program to change to a different technology (satellite or wireline) if the broadband service at a 
given location cannot perform adequately.
 
Ideally, the broadband provider should also be 
responsive and potentially modify its network

in
 
areas with many students having poor signal, 
the provider may be able to improve the situation with a deployable Cell on Wheels (CoW) 
antenna.
 
Providers may also offer outdoor antennas to boost the signal.
 
Where no other option is available, satellite tec
hnology can connect students who cannot be 
effectively connected with a wireline or mobile broadband connection. A satellite internet 
connection is far better than none at all but will be less robust than terrestrial networks for two
-
way video use in dista
nce learning.

In a pandemic environment, a scenario in which

A 25/3 Mbps connection might be 
workable if internet usage were mainly in the form of intern
et browsing, email, and even 
streaming movies (i.e., primarily downloads). But essential applications in the context of a 
pandemic, video conferencing and tele

medicine, demand high bandwidth in the upload 
direction as well. For example
, 
while there is no 
specific set minimum for healthcare broadband 
speeds, many telehealth programs require a minimum of 1.5 Mbps for both upload and download 
speeds to successfully display audio and video data.

Available within range of wireless towers across State.
 
ii.
 
May be able to support distance learning, depending on location of 
antennas and student, the type 
of technology (mobile must be 4G or 
better), the connection to the tower (fiber), and the level of congestion.
 
iii.
 
Scalability

depending on service area, available spectrum, type of 
technology and number of users, a tower may be able to connect dozens 
of stude

66
 
i.
 
Not all parts of State have wireless coverage, particularly i
ndoors, in rural 
areas, in treed or hilly areas, or away from main roads and towns.
 
ii.
 
Not always scalable

sharp increases in use (like adding thousands of 
distance learners) may use up all the bandwidth, especially in rural areas 
where towers already tend to
 
have slower connections.
 
iii.
 
Difficult to predict where and when speed and service exist

while 
providers know where towers are and how they are connected, the actual 
service depends on dozens of factors that vary from place to place and 
change unpredictably (
terrain, indoor/outdoors, number of users, material 
in a building)

this is why wireless providers tend not to advertise or 
promise speeds.
 
iv.
 

network

because of the technical challenge 
of wireless, it is harder to get 
speed in the upstream direction than with wired technologies, which can 
result in poor quality of signal from the student to the network, and fuzzy 
or broken images and poor sound quality.
 
v.
 
Fixed wireless providers typically
 
need to perform installation at the home.
 
4)
 
Satellite
 
a.
 
Advantages
 
i.
 
Available anywhere there is an unobstructed view from the house to the 
south and an antenna can be mounted on the roof or the house.
 
ii.
 
Can provide high speed for distance learning in downstream 
signal 
(network to student).
 
iii.
 
Scalability

depending on service area, congestion on network and 
number of users, a satellite may be able to connect thousands of students 
to distance learning.
 
b.
 
Disadvantages
 
i.
 
Signal has to travel a long distance through 
space, so there is a significant 
delay, making distance learning and videoconferencing confusing and 
difficult at times.

Strategic Recommendations
 
The 
Covid
-
19 pandemic has laid bare the challenges faced by Vermonters who do not have 
quality, residential broadband internet. This analysis, narrowly defined, focuses on creating 
actionable steps to ensure signifi
cantly increased broadband access during the pandemic. While 
many of these recommendations may not contribute to 
long
-
term
 
solutions, they can deliver 
broadband 
swiftly 
to those who need it most as an immediate solution in the pandemic
.
 
As discussed, Vermo
nters without home broadband internet fall into three categories:
 

 
L
ow
-
income Vermonters 
who are potentially served 
with available infrastructure for 
25/3 broadband, but unable to afford it
 

 
Unserved Vermonters without access to broadband who could and would
 
pay for 
service, if the infrastructure was made available
 

 
Unserved, low
-
income Vermonters without access to broadband who also need 
assistance paying for monthly service
 
 
These three categories are addressed in our recommendations, where we provide estima
ted 
numbers 
of
 
people in each group and the likely costs needed to provide a solution to them.
 
 
Below are 
an approximate number of Vermonters who fit into each category outlined above.
 
The State may wish to use other thresholds to determine eligibility.

These numbers are meant to provide be
nchmarks to lawmakers and stakeholders in 
understanding the scope of the challenges. It should be noted that the data used has two main 
sources of variability. First, the data on which premises are served vs unserved is largely from 
2019, and though we hav
e removed premises served by the Emergency Connectivity Initiative, 
many ISPs reported doing some additional deployment this year.
 
 
Second, tracking accurate data on who is low
-
income during a pandemic when spikes in cases 
continue to affect businesses, em
ployment, and income levels. 
The State
 
should choose an 
income threshold they feel is clear and appropriate
,
 
so eligibility is easily understood.
 
 
To estimate the number of people each of our strategic recommendations can reach and 
estimate costs to do so,
 
we used various forms of geospatial analysis, cost estimates based on 
what the project team has seen in other states, and data from state and federal sources. To the 
extent we can, we will refine our estimations if updated data becomes available to us, fo
r the 
final report.
 
 
8.1
 
Recommendation for Broadband Subsidy Plan
 
We recommend that the State of Vermont bulk purchase internet service to connect low
-
income 
households with K
-
12 students so that they can participate in distance learning for the coming 
year, on the assumption that the pandemic may last that long. Given available funding, it may 
also be possible to extend the program to other low
-
income households for purposes of 
telehealth service, post
-
secondary education, employment searches, and job t
raining.
 
The following offers a recommended strategy to implement such a program, with the following 
key priorities in mind: 
 
1.
 
Service must be able to support meaningful remote work and learning activities
 
2.
 
Quality service must be equally accessible to all e
ligible students
 
3.
 
The plan should be efficient, non
-
burdensome, and capable of enabling service to eligible 
households as soon as possible
 
Because the quality of service and the timeline on which it must be delivered is paramount, our 
recommendations seek t
o leverage existing mechanisms whenever possible, and to allocate 
responsibilities among entities in a manner that maximizes strengths to ensure effective and 
efficient program implementation.
 
While there will be challenges inherent in this program related
 
to the unequal distribution of 

been working to address the rural digital divide for a number of years and that Vermont currently 
manages a successful, well

While Vermont

specific data about home broadband adoption based on income is not available, 
national data consistently shows that adoption is drastically lower in low

income households 
than in households with hi
gher income. Data from the Pew Research Center shows that in 2019, 
92 percent of Americans with an annual income of $75,000 or more had home broadband, while 
only 56 percent of those with an annual income of less than $30,000 had home broadband.

service is the primary reason for choosing not to subscribe.
34
 
The fact that high cost so often keeps broadband service out of reach even when it is physically 
available is critical, because it means that the need for assistance extends throughout the enti
re 
State of Vermont (and, indeed, the entirety of the United States), as opposed to solely in rural 
communities. 
 
At the current time, there does not exist reliable data regarding which low
-
income Vermont 
households are not connected to broadband. In the a
bsence of such data, we recommend 
development of a program that would apply broadly based on income level rather than based on 
current levels of connectivity. 
 
8.1.2
 
Technology Assessment and Recommended Service Requirements
 
Bringing service to hundreds of thous
ands of Vermont homes on an expedited basis is a 
significant logistical and technical challenge.
 
Given that the need is urgent and immediate, it will 
not be feasible to significantly expand core networks.
 
 
For example, it will not be possible for 
wireline providers to construct any significant amount of 
new cables on utility poles or place cable underground in rights
-
of
-
way.
 
Wireline providers will 
either serve customers who already have connections, or who are already passed by a cable on 
the stre
et. Wireless providers

mobile as well as fixed

will not be able to construct new towers 
or new antennas, nor place new fiber optic cables to those towers.
 
Wireless providers will only 
be able to provide new user devices (such as Wi
-
Fi hotspots) and perform
 
smaller

scale upgrades,

such as changing the speeds or configurations of equipment using software or placing temporary 
antennas.
 
As a result, to meet 
the State

resources.
 
Rather than prioritiz
ing new construction and engineering, service providers will need 
to dedicate staff to acquire, configure, and ship equipment. They will need to enter new 
customers into their billing and support systems and provide customer support.
 
They will need 
to inst
all service at customer homes. In addition, in order to alleviate strains on existing networks 
that will result from the sudden addition of a large number of new customers, including a broad 
array of locally available providers is preferable to contracting
 
with only a few large providers.
 
8.1.2.1
 
Recommended Performance Characteristics for Services
 
Based on discussions with educators in 
the State
, this report recommends technical specifications 
for service that can support meaningful distance learning, telehealth, 
and job retraining (
Table 
1
). These specifications can be provided by different types of service providers, and, given the 
scale of the challenge, will require the full
 
participation of multiple service providers to fulfill 
across the State.

Particular Challenges in the Unserved Parts of the State
 
The challenge remains that broadband infrastructure is distributed unevenly throughout the 
State

a pattern that is consistent with that of the rest of the country. There has been an 
 Covid

exemplary ongoing effort on the part of 
Vermont
 
to 
incentivize constructio
n of 
new 
infrastructure, and while progress is being made, gaps still remain.
 
To address the challenges with connectivity, this program will need to
 
maximize 
use of 
existing 
networks across all platforms. The scale of the effort to connect all eligible sch
oolchildren to 
home broadband far out
-
scales
 
the capacity of any single network, both in terms of footprint and 
capacity. To that end, the success of this program depends on the strategic maximization of all 
available broadband networks
, utilizing 
a layere
d approach. 
 
Because wireline networks often have more capacity than their wireless and cellular 
counterparts, wireline broadband connections should be prioritized wherever they are available. 
In areas where wireline broadband is not available, mobile cell
ular service can be used where the 
signal is strong enough. Finally, satellite service can be used to fill in remaining gaps where 
neither wireline 
n
or cellular 25/3 Mbps service is possible. 
 
8.1.3
 
Potential Program Scale and Budget
 
The likely budget for the 
full program is summarized below and is based on a number of 
assumptions regarding the potential cost per household for service over 12 months, bundled with 
the necessary equipment and installation to make service possible.
 
8.1.3.1
 
Program Eligibility and Budget C
onsiderations
 
We
 
recommend that 
the State
 
l
everage existing eligibility parameters for the National School 
Lunch Program, which offers free and reduced
-
price school meals to low
-
income students, to 
determine initial eligibility for this program.
35
 
In creat
ing parallel eligibility, the State would be 
able to significantly reduce the complexity of implementing a new program, resulting in fast 
execution and efficient distribution of resources to families identified as being in need. 
 
Based on data provided by 
the Vermont Department of Education, we understand that 
approximately 32,000 students in Vermont schools are eligible for the National School Lunch 
Program. Based on average household sizes, this equates to approximately 20,000 eligible 
households. Should 
the State choose to expand eligibility, additional households could be added, 
including those eligible for Medicaid (enabling telehealth services) and unemployment insurance 
payments (enabling online job searches and worker retraining). This analysis assum
es eligibility 
of 20,000 households, but the numbers can be increased in a linear fashion if eligibility is 
expanded.
 
 
35
 
Based on eligibility parameters for free and reduced
-
cost school meals, the following students would be eligible: 
(1) 
Those
 
in households with incomes at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level; and (2) 
those
 
in 
households participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
 
and 
Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families, as well as foster youth, migrant, homeless, or runaway youth, and Head Start participants. 
 
 Covid

19 
Response Telecommunications Recovery Plan

November 2020
 
73
 
In brief, we estimate that approximately $7 million could be used for a one
-
year term, based on 
average costs per household of $350 and as
suming utilization by 20,000 low
-
income Vermont 
households.
36
 
The potential budget is thus based on an estimated cost per household of $350 for 
12 months of service, including installation and equipment, as follows:
 
Fixed service:
 
 
$
1
50 
for service
 
$200 fo
r home equipment and installation
 
Mobile service:
 
 
$250 for service
 
$100 for mobile hotspot device
 
 
Given the uncertainties regarding how many eligible households might participate in the 
program, it is prudent to develop a contingency plan for surplus f
unds. A
 
determination 
of 
whether to repurpose unused funds c
ould be made 
after several months of program execution. 
If the data show
 
that fewer households than expected utilize the benefit, the surplus funds can 
be repurposed to support other low
-
income us
ers
, including low
-
income p
ost
-
secondary 
students
 
and t
elehealth users
.
 
8.1.4
 
Recommended Process
 
This report recommends the following process to quickly and efficiently procure bulk internet 
service to provide eligible students home broadband 
connectivity. The recommendations seek 
to leverage existing mechanisms whenever possible, and to allocate responsibilities among 
entities in a manner that maximizes strengths to ensure effective and efficient program 
implementation.
 
Given the urgency of th
is effort, it will be critical to keep the process as simple and efficient as 
possible and to allocate roles and responsibility efficiently, without duplication of effort or need 
for extensive preparation time. The process recommended below seeks to create
 
that level of 
efficiency. The following graphic illustrates the process recommended, which is described in 
greater detail below.
 
 
36
 
The great uncertainty in the projected budg
et concerns the level of participation by eligible households. There is 
no precedent for this program, which makes challenging projections regarding how many households will choose 
to take advantage of the program. As a result, there is a certain level of 
uncertainty about how much funding will 
be utilized.

8.1.4.1
 
Procurement Mechanism
 
We recommend that the State utilize existing contracts with providers wherever possible and 
also issue a simple solicitation document, appropriate to State procurement rules, that seeks to 
identify additional providers that are able to meet requirements re
lated to broadband service, 
customer service, equipment and installation, and reporting. 
 
This proposed process seeks to leverage existing State contracts wherever possible and utilizes 
an emergency declaration in order to rapidly procure new services that
 
meet the RFP 
requirements.
 
Due to the scale of this effort, a multi
-
provider solution is necessary in order to reach all eligible 
students and to avoid overloading any one network to the point of severe service degradation. 
The recommended procurement str
ucture is intended to capture all respondents that would be 
capable of providing services that meet the technical specifications outlined in Table 1, above. 
 
8.1.4.1.1
 
Procurement Structure
 
Based on best practices, the following components should be included in a co
mprehensive yet 
efficient procurement:
 
1.
 
Geographic coverage
.
 
Respondents should be asked to provide a map of the State of 
Vermont indicating ZIP codes or census blocks where service is available that meets the 
capacity and data requirements outlined in the 
item below. The map should indicate 
where there may be service limitations, such as a chance of lower speeds or poor 
performance indoors. 
 
2.
 
Service requirements.
 
Respondents should be asked to indicate their ability to meet the 
following requirements.
 
a)
 
Minimum required 
capacity
. Eligible service will perform indoors at minimum 
speeds of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload, with no limitations on speed 
dependent on the time of day. Terrestrial networks will have latency less than 150 
ms. 
 
b)
 
Minimum required 
data
.
 
Eligible service will provide unlimited data, with a 
minimum of 25 GB of data available at an unthrottled capacity, per household 
served per month. There will be no limits on data use dependent on time of day.
 
c)
 
Equipment and installation requirements.
 
Respondents must provide the 
equipment necessary to enable in
-
building Wi
-
Fi within the home, including but 
not limited to modems, routers, or hotspot devices. Such equipment must be 
capable of connecting at least five devices simultaneously through Wi
-
Fi
. 
 Covid
-
19 
Response Telecommunications Recovery Plan
 
| DRAFT | 
November 2020
 
76
 
Respondents must be able to provide installation services as necessary and when 
customer self
-
installation is not possible. Any necessary in
-
home installations 
must follow appropriate social distancing guidelines and use of masks or other 
personal protec
tive equipment (PPE), as determined appropriate by the State. If 
devices are to work directly out of the box, they should be delivered to the home 
and with included instructions.
 
d)
 
Customer service obligations
. 
Respondents must indicate their ability to make
 
customer service available between 8am and 5pm Central time, seven days a 
week, for the extent of the service period.
 
3.
 
Timeline.
 
Respondents must indicate their ability to offer service beginning as soon as 
possible and continuing for one year.
 
4.
 
Proposed 
pricing
. 
Respondents should indicate proposed pricing for such services, on a 
per
-
household basis, for service, equipment, and installation (if any) for one year. 
 
5.
 
Reporting requirements
. 
Reporting requirements will be included as deemed necessary 
by the S
tate.
 
6.
 
Invoice format
. 
A standardized invoice format will be developed and included in the RFP 
so that submissions by providers are consistent and aligned with State requirements.
 
8.1.5
 
Service Enrollment and Installation
 
Based on best practices in other 
states, we recommend that the State directly mail each eligible 
household a package that contains the following:
 

 
A code that is unique to that household
 
and can be used to redeem service directly 
with a participating service provider
 

 
Information about the 
program, including a phone number for the customer service 
office within the State, and a step
-
by
-
step explanation of how the code can be used to 
redeem service
 

 
District
-
specific information about participating providers and a phone number to 
contact each 
provider for service enrollment
 
Families may then choose the service they wish to receive and use their unique code to enroll 
directly with the service provider.
 
8.1.5.1
 
Invoicing and Payment
 
We recommend that participating service providers be required to track a
nd collocate 
households served at least once per month, and submit to the State a single monthly invoice 
 Covid
-
19 
Response Telecommunications Recovery Plan
 
| DRAFT | 
November 2020
 
77
 
based on the number of service connections made that month, as well as a list of the individual 
voucher codes that have been used to redeem service. 
 
S
ervice providers would invoice the State directly and submit one invoice on a monthly basis 
based on the number of connections set up during the preceding month. This strategy vastly 
simplifies the invoicing process for both the provider and the State, ena
bling a streamlined 
transaction and efficient compensation. 
 
8.1.5.2
 
Program Support and Service Validation
 
CTC recommends that the State create a small office in order to provide program support and 
service validation to ensure the integrity of the program. The o

include:
 

 
Develop and distribute promotional and informational materials to families and school 
districts, including:
 
o
 
Catalog of services
 
o
 
Explanatory information regarding each 
provider
 
and 
their 
service offering
 
o
 
Map of 
provider
 
coverage areas
 
o
 
Explanatory information regarding accessing 
and using vouchers, including 
how to sign up for service with providers
 
o
 
Instructions for accessing customer service
 
o
 
Draft materials for communications with families
 

 
Develop and maintain a 
d
edicated website with all written and webinar materials, to be 
updated frequently
 

 
Develop and deliver a s
eries of webinars to communicate 
this 
information to 
the school 
districts
 

 
Provide customer service support to eligible families as they navigate the p
rogram. We 
recommend that a customer service telephone line be made available and staffed 
between 8 am to 5 pm from project initiation. Customer service representatives should 
be able to answer questions from families and intervene with providers in the ev
ent of 
customer challenges (such as service not working or significant delays associated with 
installation). Escalation to technical support, made available during the same hours, 
should also be available

Access for Unserved Vermonters
 
In many areas of the 
S
tate, Vermonters cannot access broadband internet at any price due to a 
lack of infrastructure. These places are often rural, low
-
density areas where it is not profitable 
for pr
ivate Internet Service Providers to extend service.
 
 
The State of Vermont has long recognized the need for more robust broadband infrastructure 
and has set a statutory goal of serving every E911 address with 100/100 Mbps service by 2024. 
The State has take
n many steps to improve broadband access over the last decade, including 
creating the Vermont Universal Service Fund, allowing the creation of Communication Union 
Districts (CUDs), and using loans from the Vermont Economic Development Authority to facilita
te 
broadband expansion.

Still, many gaps remain, and the Covid
-
19 pandemic has introduced new challenges to those 
without access to broadband. According to Public Service Department data, there are 60,511 
premises in Vermont without access to broadband inf
rastructure that could deliver speeds of at 
least 25/3 Mbps, excluding those that will soon receive service under the Emergency Connectivity 
Initiative and GVCNI. (For the purposes of this report, locations that will soon be served by the 
Emergency Connect
ivity Initiative and GVCNI are considered served.)
 
8.2.1
 
Types of Unserved Premises
 

numbers do not indicate prioritization or emphasis in terms of the 
S

broadband gaps; the numbers are merely a convenient way to refe
r to the categories. All three 
of these categories of unserved premises are prevalent and distributed throughout the 
S
tate.
 

 
Category 1: Large, contiguous unserved areas where there is no wired provider available 
for miles. 
These areas are 
typically rural and have a low density of premises per mile. 
CUD
s
 
in particular are eager to serve these areas as it is significantly cheaper 
for a new 
provider 
to build out in areas with no existing cable or fiber presence, and being the only 
provider off
ering 25/3 much less 100/100 in those areas provides for healthy penetration 
rates.
 
However, these
 
areas cannot be connected 
with
 
wired service quickly 
enough to 
address the Covid
-
19 pandemic, 
as the infrastructure does not exist in close proximity; 
howeve
r, wireless infrastructure, including 4G LTE service, does reach the majority of 
these locations.
 
 

 
Category 2: Discrete clusters of unserved addresses in an otherwise largely served area. 

houses. The isolated 
unserved premises are typically on roads that are particularly long relative to the number 
of potential broadband customers on the road; in other words, they have a lower density 
of potential customers than the surrounding areas. The i
ncumbent ISP has not built 
infrastructure on those roads because their potential return on investment is not great 
enough to prompt an investment in reaching the potential customers who live there. 
Given the low density of houses, too, a cable provider is 
not obligated to build 
infrastructure on those roads under the terms of their cable franchise agreements with 
the local jurisdiction.
 
 
For the residents on roads like these, which exist in locations in many parts of the 
S
tate, 
this situation is particularl

road

which the residents would be required to pay in order to get service from those 
companies

can be high. Furthermore, these locations are unlikely to be served by a CUD 
or another competitor 
in the near future because of similar investment costs and lack of 
return needed to keep CUDs sustainable. Reaching these locations would require

overbuilding significant amounts of cable or fiber, which increases construction costs, and 
due to the low
-
den
sity in these areas, means expected revenue is low. Based on our 
analysis, an estimated 16,000 unserved premises are within a half
-
mile on either side of 
existing cable or fiber infrastructure, and 27,000 unserved premises are within a mile of 
existing inf
rastructure
.
 
(
N
ote, this calculation includes premises with lengthy drops, 
mentioned below.)
 
 
Figure

: Unserved Premises Close to Existing Infrastructure
 
 
However, we advise that the Public Service Department identify the pocket
s to be 
prioritized by line extensions, rather than large, contiguous sections that extend out into 
category 1 areas. The map (above) of portions of the western side of the
 
State 
illustrates 
the difference between Category 1 unserved contiguous areas, and 
Category 2: unserved

mile distance from existing cable and 
fiber plant (Category 1); green circles identify unserved pockets surrounded by, and a 
short distance away from, existing wired service (Category 2)
.

Category 3: Premises with long driveways or requiring underground conduit. 
Here, 
homeowners struggle to get service, despite the presence of broadband infrastructure 
passing the 
entrance to their driveway
, due to being set so far back from the road that 

no cost to the customer. This generally refers to locations where the home or business is 
more than 300 feet away from the road

that distance being the typical limi
t for cable 

 
 
Additionally, ISPs may charge customers for installations that must be connected via 
underground conduit; manufactured housing parks in particular often must be con
nected 
by underground conduit. Although these homes are effectively unserved because many 
homeowners find the drop construction cost unaffordable, the homes do not always fit 
into the category of unserved for purposes of federal or Emergency Connectivity I
nitiative 
funding. The
 
State 
has taken some actions to solve this problem, though: GVCNI funds

Therefore, recommendations focus on leveraging existing infrastructure whenever possible.
 
 

economical solutions are tried first; more challenging, slower, and/or more expensive solutions 
are implemented in areas where the optimal solutions are not viable.
 
The triage is as follows:

In addition, re
cent roaming agreements between VTel and cell carriers, and the fact that not all 
roads were surveyed likely make this number 
significantly
 
higher.
 
 
Using the threshold of 22
 
percent
 
of Vermonters as qualifying as low income, we project that 
9,750 of these households may qualify for the recommended subsidy program, and should the
 
State 
anticipate subsidizing mobile hotspots for all of these low
-
income premises for 1 year, the 
cost wou
ld be approximately $2.4
 
million
.

Targeted Cable and Fiber Line 
E
xtensions
 
Many Vermonters live 
in proximity to areas served by
 
cable networks but 
their homes are not 
passed by cable service
. These pockets of unserved locations are unlikely to be served b
y entities 
other than the 
providers that are already close by
, as that would require costly 
and 
extensive 
construction 
by the new provider solely 
to reach them.
 
An estimated 16,000 unserved premises are within a half a mile of a cable or fiber line, and 27
,000 
unserved premises are within a mile buffer, although some of these premises are located on the 
outskirts of existing wired infrastructure
 
(Category 1)
 
and are therefore not considered in an 

 
(Category 2).
 
The project team identified 3
9 towns where at least 85
 
percent
 
of the existing road miles are already served by cable or fiber; these towns are most likely to have 
islands of unserved premises. In these towns, there are 1
,
762 premises 
in islands 
within 
0
.5 miles 
of existing cable or fiber, and 2023 premises within 
1
 
mile of fiber. There are 
approximately 
186.6 
road miles without infrastructure, not including interstates and two
-
lane highways. Assuming the 
cost of cable and fiber deployment remains at $30,
000 per mile (the number the State of 
Vermont has used as a benchmark for cable line extensions), the project team estimates that 
building out the 
unserved islands in the 
39 priority towns would cost $5.6
 
million
. This results in 
a cost per premise
s
 
of $2,
768.
 
 
A
n explanation of our methodology and details on each 
of these towns
 
are in 
A
ppendix
 
G
. 
Because these deployments are extending existing infrastructure, the project team believes
 
that 
with sufficient resources
 
and cooperation by the cable and fiber p
roviders
, this deployment could 
be completed by the end of the year and if possible, funded using CARES Act dollars.

Some Vermonters have weak cellular service 
and would not be able to get consistent broadband 
but 
would be
 
able to get significantly better service by installing
 
cell service repeaters, also known 

number of Vermonters to receive adequate internet speeds on existi
ng cellular networks. Using 

 
(expanding to areas with any measured 
speed, and any area within one

half mile of those areas)
, we 
estimate 
that about 3,700 
additional 
unserved locations likely have weak 
cell service and could benefit from repeaters. (If VTel

The project team recommends the State of Vermont notify residents who may benefit from signal 
boosters and provide a list of options. The project team recommends that th
e State bulk purchase 
signal boosters for an estimated 820 low
-
income households that would benefit; another 775 
low
-
income households would likely benefit from a cell service repeater if VTel expands its 
network. The State should also consider the bulk pu
rchase of signal boosters for
 
additional 
Vermonters
 
who are not below the low
-
income threshold
, which would allow them to access 
better service without needing to pay as much for the installation of new equipment.
 
 
As described below, the proposed Broadband Corps could install these signal boosters for 
Vermonters. Corps members will receive a simple training on installation, as well as 
Covid
-

safety precautions.
 
 
Cell signal boosters typically cost about $400, with
 
installation costs of about $350. Assuming the 
Broadband Corps is able to complete installations and the
 
State 
can negotiate a lower price when 
purchasing in bulk, the project team estimates that the State of Vermont can install signal 
boosters for 1,575 
low
-
income households for about $535,000.

team does not recommend that the State of Vermont fund the deployment of this type of

Nearly all locations within a

small

require time from PSD employees or employees from other agencie

have been working on these types of hyper local solutions 

 
from 
Addison County to the Northeast Kingdom. Individuals with experience could be supported by

Consistent through interviews and survey feedback, stakeholders have illustrated a need for
 
more hands

on resources to assist with the technical issues that inevitably arise as the
 
State 
moves online. Schools tech directors that were busy serving an in

need to also assist educators, students and parents for both online and in person instruction. 
Healthcare providers report that appointments take longer due to technology barriers and state 
that they often are using appointment ti
me to walk patients through use of their online systems. 
And the rapid distribution of wireless devices and boosters to connect many unserved locations 
will require relatively low skill but intensive work on the ground.
 
 
8.3.1
 
Overview of Broadband Corps Tasks
 
A
 
quickly organized Broadband Corps could address these gaps through organizing volunteers 
through the CUDs and providing direct service to Vermonters to make sure as many as possible 
are connected quickly and able to use this new connectivity.
 
We recommend
 
the creation of a Broadband Corps to perform the following tasks:
 
 
1)
 
Assist with infrastructure and service deployment
. Corps members will assist 
Vermonters to measure what type of hot spot would work best, and whether a signal 
booster is needed.
 
Corps 
members would also be responsible for installations, updating 
coverage maps, and other duties related to infrastructure deployment. Installation of 
signal boosters are very simple efforts that require few specialized skills and could be ideal 
for volunteer
 
efforts.
 
2)
 
Perform outreach, and direct technical support to Vermonters becoming familiar with 
their broadband connections and devices.
 
Corps members will work with schools, 
 Covid
-
19 
Response Telecommunications Recovery Plan

libraries, town administrators, CUDs, to increase effective utilization of devices 
and online 
tools. Structured as a digital literacy help desk that used telephone service to engage 
participants, Corps members would deliver support to those unfamiliar with core video 
conferencing tools, as well as specific applications related to remote 
education and 
telehealth.
 
 
3)
 

-
income Vermonters take advantage of 
broadband support programs.
 
Enrollment in programs for low
-
income Vermonters 

 
from
 
State 
subsidies to ISP specific programs 

 
is very low.
 
In collabo
ration with regional 
organizations who work with low income populations, Broadband Corps members can 
undertake proactive outreach to eligible Vermonters and provide phone based support 
to ensure applications get processed and submitted.
 
 
If the Corps is su
ccessful in connecting Vermonters rapidly, we recommend in the Spring that 
Corps members spend available time on pole surveys of towns on behalf of CUDs and thereby 
advance their work toward deploying fiber.
 
 
8.3.2
 
Possible Broadband Corps Structure and Scale
 
We
 
have created a sample 
B
roadband 
C
orps structure that combines regionally assigned Corps 
members with a statewide installation team. Corps members could be assigned to Regional 
Planning Commission regions, and could work closely with RPCs and/or CUDs if de
sired, with 
statewide management based in a central location. We recommend at least 22 regional corps 
members (
two
 
for each RPC region), and at least 20 statewide corps members.
 
 
Regional corps members would be focused on evaluating the viability of
 
hotspo
t or booster for 
unserved households. Statewide corps members would comprise the trained installation teams. 
Though this may seem like extra driving for the central corps members, central storage of 
equipment provides great efficiencies, and this is how in
stallation teams in the renewable energy 
space and other similar ventures operate.
 
 
A recommended management structure for 
the 
Broadband Corps would include a statewide 
director, two to three regional managers, one data manager, and one 
operations manager. The 
initiative could be assigned to a nonprofit with experience in this arena or potentially managed 
under the SerVermont office with the understanding that traditionally the Vermont National 
Service Commission has been largely focused 
on distributing AmeriCorps resources, not 
managing direct service activities. Though this structure would also work well as an AmeriCorps 
program with the benefits that kind of structure provides (
e.g., 
insurance, recruiting support
,
 
education award
s
), inc
orporating it into this national structure would likely delay the project by 
many months
 
or longer
. There would remain opportunities to leverage other national service 
programs like the National Community Conservation Corps (NCCC)
, which
 
has the ability to
 
quickly deploy teams of trained AmeriCorps members to a state for 
six

projects like this one, although preparation
s would need to be made
 
to maximize the value of 
this 
deployment
. Once this program is underway, SerVermont could evalua
te whether the 
initiative could be transitioned to a statewide AmeriCorps program.
 
 
While a Corps could be put together quickly to get started as early as December, it is likely such 
a team would be focused on executing for a six
-
month period. Below is a d

Appendix
 
A: Residential Survey Results
 
Executive Summary
 
As part of its efforts to perform a comprehensive evaluation of broadband gaps during the Covid
-
19 pandemic, the State of 
Vermont
 
commissioned an online survey of households. The survey 
was intended to gather basic data about the types of services to which
 
residents subscribe and 
their use of these services (including subsidized programs such as Comcast Internet Essentials). 
Moreover, the survey was designed to provide insights about how the pandemic has impacted 

mes and locations inside and outside the home and 
whether internet service is sufficient to meet the needs of households across 
the State
.
 
Almost all respondents have access to the internet, which is to be expected of online survey 
participants. At the sam

needs during the pandemic. Usage in the home at various times and for various activities has 
increased significantly during the pandemic, at the same time that satisfaction with connectio
n 
speed and reliability has decreased. Many respondents disagreed that their home internet 
connection is adequate to meet their needs, particularly for attending online classes and doing 
homework. Additionally, very few respondents (8
 
percent
) feel that pu
blic Wi
-
Fi access in their 
area is adequate. 
 
This 
appendix
 
documents the survey process, discusses methodologies, and presents results 
intended to assist the State in developing strategies to close the identified gaps.
 
 
Key Findings
 
K
ey findings 
are here presented thematically in two subsections: broadband access gaps and 
Covid
-
19 impacts on broadband use. 
These and other findings are presented in greater detail in 
the body of the report.
 
Broadband Access Gaps
 
The survey found very few gaps in acq
uisition of residential internet access services, but also that 
relatively few residents are taking advantage of available subsidized programs. 
The following are 
key findings:
 

 
Most
 
residents do 
have home internet access
.
 
Most (96%) reported having internet
 
access, 
including 79 percent who have both home internet service and a cellular/mobile telephone 
service with internet (smartphone). The high saturation of internet access would be 
expected in an online survey.
 

 
Five 
percent of all respondents
 
and nine per
cent of low
-
income households (earning less 
than $25,000 per year)
 
only use a smartphone for home internet access.
 
This may limit 
their ability to fully utilize online services at home.

Comcast Xfinity and Consolidated Communications (CCI)
 
are the leading 
internet service 
providers used
. 
Three in 10 respondents subscribe to Comcast Xfinity, and three in 10 
subscribe to CCI. Other ISPs comprise much smaller shares of the market statewide but may 
represent larger shares in some individual counties. Further de
tail on companies used by 
respondents are provided in the body of the report.
 

 
Residents
 
may be significantly underutilizing existing broadband subsidy programs. 
Only 
one percent of all Comcast subscribers, and 10 percent of low
-
income subscribers, 
particip
ate in the Comcast Internet Essentials program. Another 59 percent of low
-
income 
subscribers were unaware of the program, and 15 percent attempted to enroll but were 
declined.
 
 

 
Most (99 percent) respondents access the internet from any location, 
including a range of 
locations outside the home.
 
However, use of the internet outside of the home has declined 
significantly during the Covid
-
19 pandemic.
 

 
Most respondents are unaware of 
the State

Districts. 
Three in 10 
re
spondents said they a
re aware of CUDs as a way to improve 
broadband access in unserved areas
, while 59 percent are unaware and 11 percent are 
unsure.
 

 
Public Wi
-
Fi access may not be adequate.
 
Nearly one
-
half of respondents (45%) are aware 
of public Wi
-
Fi ho
tspot locations near their home, but just eight percent said that hotspot 
access is adequate in the area. Another 43 percent were unsure.
 

 
Most respondents use search engines to learn about availability of internet service.
 
Two
-
thirds named search engines a
s the leading source of information to learn about available 
service options, and seven in 10 named search engines as the top source for learning how 
to use the internet more effectively.
 
Covid
-
19 Impacts on Broadband Use
 
Respondents reported increased use
 
of and demand for broadband services during the Covid
-
19 
pandemic. They are utilizing the internet more at home and less often outside the home, as may 
be expected, and they are engaged in more online activities for work, school, and entertainment.
 
The 
following are key findings:
 

 
Daily use of
 
home
 
internet services at various times has increased during the pandemic
. 
Prior to the Covid
-
19 pandemic, just over one
-
half of respondents made daily use of the 
internet mid
-
morning or early afternoon, compared wi
th approximately nine in 10 
respondents during the pandemic. Four in 10 households have at least three members 
online during peak usage times during the Covid
-
19 pandemic.
 

 
U
se of internet services outside of the home has declined significantly during the C
ovid
-
19 pandemic.
 
Use of the internet in key areas decreased significantly when comparing

Covid, including in work settings (79% vs. 56%), private 
businesses (65% vs. 27%), schools or colleges (38% vs. 20%), and public building
s (37% vs. 
18%).
 

 
E
ngagement in online activities has increased significantly during the Covid
-
19 
pandemic.
 
Use of the internet for telemedicine or medical appointments (19% vs. 75%) 
and for civic engagement (33% vs. 74%) increased substantially from pre
-
pa
ndemic to 
during
-
pandemic, although some of the use is at a monthly or less than monthly basis. 
Additionally, 62 percent of respondents use the internet for teleworking on a daily basis, 
compared with 21 percent of respondents before the pandemic.
 

 
Satisfac
tion with internet service aspects has decreased during the pandemic, 
particularly for speed and reliability of service.
 
M
ore than one
-
half of respondents are 
not at all satisfied (approximately one
-
third) or are only slightly satisfied (approximately 
one
-
fifth) with connection speed and reliability during the pandemic. 
 

 
Many respondents have experienced some challenge with accessing telehealth or an 
online medical appointment during the pandemic.
 
Specifically, four in 10 respondents 
experienced an issue (e
.g. having to switch from video to audio only), while three in 10 
have not had a medical appointment and another three in 10 did not respond or had no 
issue.
 

 
Most households with children have internet access, but it may not be sufficient for 
some families
.
 
Most respondents disagreed that their children have to do homework or 
distance learn at various locations outside the home (although 13 percent agreed or 
strongly agreed that their children cannot complete their homework or cannot distance 
learn because 
they do not have access to the internet at home.) However, four in 10 
respondents strongly disagreed that
 
their home internet connection is adequate for their

Survey Process
 
and Data Analysis
 
CTC, in close coordination with the State of Vermont, managed the survey project, including 
development of the questionnaire, programming and hosting the online
 
survey, survey data 
analysis, and reporting of results. CTC developed the draft survey instrument and the State 
provided revisions and approved the final questionnaire. A total of 3,046 useable surveys were 
completed by the date of analysis.
 
The survey re
sponses were entered into SPSS
37
 
software and the entries were coded and labeled. 
SPSS databases were formatted, cleaned, and verified prior to the data analysis. The survey data 
was evaluated using techniques in SPSS including frequency tables, cross
-
tabu
lations, and means 
functions. Statistically significant differences between subgroups of response categories are 
highlighted and discussed where relevant.
 
The survey responses were weighted based on the age of the respondent and region. Since older 
persons
 
are more likely to respond to surveys than younger persons, the age
-
weighting corrects 
for the potential bias based on the age of the respondent. In this manner, the results more closely

Respondents were asked a series of questions on how their broadband use has changed during 
the Covid
-
19 pandemic, including impacts on time and location of internet use, engagement in 
vario
us internet activities, satisfaction with internet service, distance learning, and consumption 
of PEG programming. This information provides valuable insight into demand for broadband 
service during the pandemic.
 
Internet Use at Various Times
 
Respondents were asked to indicate how often they use the internet at various times 
before

throughout the day, whereas prior to the pandemic usage was lower during daytime hours and

Internet Use by Location
 
Respondents were also asked to indicate how often they use the internet in various locations 
before
 
and 
during
 
the Covid
-
19 pandemic. As shown in 
Figure 
56
, use of internet services outside 
of the home has declined significantly during the pandemic, which makes sense as m
any public 
areas and work settings have not been accessible.

(65% vs. 27%) when comparing pre

Use of the internet at schools 
or colleges declined from 38 percent of respondents pre

Covid to 20 percent currently. Use in 
libraries (42% vs. 14%), public buildings (37
% vs. 18%), and outdoor public spaces (64% vs. 51%) 
also declined. Use of the internet at the home of a friend or family member declined from 73%

Overall, respondents were only moderately satisfied with aspects of their internet service prior 
to the Covid
-
19 pandemic, and satisfaction has dropped somewhat during the pan
demic. 
Specifically, more than one
-
half of respondents are not at all satisfied or only slightly satisfied 
with connection speed and reliability during the pandemic. Just 29 percent are very or extremely 
satisfied with these service aspects, compared with 
four in 10 before the pandemic. Respondents 
are less satisfied with price compared with other service aspects, which is typical in satisfaction 
surveys. 
 
Both prior to and during the Covid
-
19 pandemic, respondents ages 65 and older expressed a 
higher level
 
of satisfaction with internet service aspects compared with younger respondents 
(see

Respondents who have a child or student in the household were asked their level of agreement 
with statements about how their child is able to distance
 
learn or do homework. Average rating 
scores are highlighted in 
Figure 
79
, while 
Figure

shows detailed responses.
 
A majority of respondents indicated that the children in their care have sufficient internet access. 
Most respondents strongly disagreed with the various statements, particularly that children do 
not have access to a com
puter or device to complete distance learning and/or homework (85%), 
that children have to distance learn or do homework using free internet services provided by 
restaurants, town government, or other entities (76%), and that students have to distance lear
n 
or do home at the home of family or friends in order to have access to the internet (11%). 
 
Still, accessibility may be an issue for a small segment of households. Particularly, 13 percent 
agreed or strongly agreed that their children cannot complete the
ir homework because they do 
not have access to the internet at home, and 13 percent agreed or strongly agreed that their 
children cannot distance learn because they do 
not
 
have access to the internet at home. 
Furthermore, the percentage of children who acc
ess the internet at a public or school library has 
decreased somewhat during the pandemic.

Respondent Information
 
Basic demographic information was gathered from survey respondents and is summarized in this 
section. Several comparisons of respondent demographic information and other survey 
questions were provided previously in this repo
rt.
 
As indicated previously 
in
 
Figure 1 regarding age
-
weighting, 
disproportionate shares of survey 
respondents were in the 
older 

 
adult population as a whole
 
(see 
Figure 
91
). Similarly, the data were weighted to account for differences in response by County. 
The weighted survey results presented in this report are adjusted to account for these differences 
and to provide results that are
 

previously.

Appendix B: Business Survey Results
 
Executive Summary
 
As part of its efforts to perform a comprehensive evaluation of broadband gaps during the Covid
-
19 pandemic, the State of 
Vermont
 
commissioned an online survey of businesses
.
 
The survey was 
intended to 
gather basic data about the types of communication services that businesses use and 
their willingness to purchase high
-
speed internet. Moreover, the survey was designed to provide 

of the internet 
and whether internet service is sufficient to meet the needs of businesses across the state.
 
Almost all businesses have access to the internet, which is to be expected of online survey 

rvice may be inadequate to meet their 
needs during the pandemic. As more employees are working remotely, some businesses are 
reporting internet issues faced by employees such as delays in uploading or downloading content 
and inability to use interactive vi
de
o
 
conferencing due to insufficient internet bandwidth. 
Reported internet speeds have declined, and satisfaction with internet reliability and speed has 
decreased during the pandemic.
 
This report documents the survey process, discusses methodologies, and 
presents results 
intended to assist the State in developing strategies to close the identified gaps.
 
 
Key Findings
 
K
ey findings 
are here presented thematically in two subsections: broadband internet usage and 
Covid
-
19 impacts on broadband use. 
These and ot
her findings are presented in greater detail in 
the body of the report.
 
Broadband Internet Usage
 
The survey found that communication services are widely used and that there are very few gaps 
in acquisition of business internet. The following are key findin
gs:
 

 
Almost all businesses have internet access
.
 
Leading types of primary internet service 
include cable modem (35%), DSL (27%), and fiber (15%). One
-
half (50%) of businesses do 
not have a backup or secondary internet connection, and 32% have a cellular/mob
ile 
connection as their backup or secondary internet connection.
 

 
The most utilized connectivity services were internet and telephone.
 
Most (99%) reported 
having internet access at their primary business location, while 75 percent have telephone 
service, 61
 
percent have cellular data service, and 54 percent have videoconferencing 
service.
 

 
Almost all (99%) businesses have personal computers.
 
Specifically, 65 percent of 
businesses have 1
-
4 computers, 21 percent have five to nine computers, and 13 percent 
 Covid

have 
ten or more computers.
 

 
Price may be a barrier to 
p
urchasing carrier
-
grade internet service.
 
Nearly two
-
thirds
 
of 
respondents
 
(65%)
 
are extremely willing to purchase 1
 
G
bps internet for $
75
 
per month, 
but 
willingness drops considerably at higher price 
points
.
 
Just eight percent of businesses would 
be extremely willing to pay $250 per month for very fast internet service, but 22 percent 
would be extremely willing to purchase carrier
-
grade Ethernet transport and internet access 
service at this price point
. Businesses would be not at all likely to slightly likely to pay more 
than $250 per month for carrier
-
grade service.
 
Covid
-
19 Impacts on Broadband Use
 
Businesses are relying more on remote work during the pandemic and at the same time are 
reporting some i
nadequacies in their broadband internet service, particularly with speed and 
reliability of service
.
 
The following are key findings:
 

 
Businesses report their internet service being slower during the pandemic
. Before the Covid
-
19 
pandemic, more than four 
in 10 respondents (42%) thought their internet connection speed was 
fast enough for their needs, dropping to 35 percent during the Covid
-
19 pandemic. Only 15% 
thought their internet connection speed was very slow and would like to be connected at much 
high
er speeds before the pandemic, while during the pandemic this number increased to 26%.
 

 
Satisfaction with internet connection speed and reliability has dropped somewhat during the 
pandemic. 
N
early one
-
half of businesses (47%) were very or extremely satisfie
d with their 

 
during the 
pandemic. Similarly, 47 percent of businesses were very or extremely satisfied with their 

pandemic.
 

 
Businesses are making more use of online platforms to sell goods or services or to engage in 
online marketing and promotions during the pandemic.
 
The percentage of businesses that 
exclusively use online platforms to sell goods or services or to e
ngage in online marketing and 
promotions has increased from six percent before the Covid
-
19 pandemic to 15 percent during 
the pandemic.
 

 
The percent of time that employees work remotely has increased during the pandemic.
 
Specifically, one
-
third of employees
 
now telework 75
-
100 percent of the time, compared with 11 
percent of employees before the pandemic.
 

 
The percentage of employees working remotely is expected to increase after the Covid
-
19 
pandemic.
 
More than four in 10 (42%) businesses said they did not h
ave a work remote option 
prior to the pandemic, while 29 percent said they do not plan to have one after the pandemic and 
seven percent are undecided. One
-
fifth of business plan to have a fully remote work option for 
some or all employees after the pandemi
c, compared with 13 percent during the pandemic.
 

 
Many businesses said that most or all of their employees (75
-
100%) experienced issues due to 
inadequate broadband service during the pandemic
. For example, one
-
third of businesses said 
that all or most of th
eir employees experienced delays in uploading or downloading content. 
 Covid

146
 
More than one
-
half of businesses said inadequate broadband service is a very significant or 
extremely significant issue.
 

 
Many businesses plan to take some action in the next 12 months re
lated to broadband internet 
service and computers.
 
Most businesses expect to obtain higher
-
quality broadband service (57%) 
and to enhance an existing website or online sales effort (56%) in the next 12 months. Fewer 
respondents expect to take other actions
; however, 15 percent plan to help employees obtain 
internet access at home and 11 percent plan to move to an area with better broadband service. 
 
Survey Process
 
and Data Analysis
 
CTC, in close coordination with the State of Vermont, managed the survey pro
ject, including 
development of the questionnaire, programming and hosting the online survey, survey data 
analysis, and reporting of results. CTC developed the draft survey instrument and the State 
provided revisions and approved the final questionnaire. A 
total of 422 completed surveys were 
received by the date of analysis
.
 
The survey responses were exported into SPSS
38
 
software and the entries were coded and 
labeled. SPSS databases were formatted, cleaned, and verified prior to the data analysis. Address 
i
nformation was merged with the survey results using the unique identifiers included in each 
survey invitation. The survey data was evaluated using techniques in SPSS including frequency 
tables and means functions. 
 
 
The following sections summarize the sur
vey findings.

19 Impacts on Business
 
Businesses were asked a series of questions on how their broadband use has changed during the 
Covid
-
19 pandemic, including impacts on connection speed, satisfaction with internet service, 
use of online platforms for selling goods or services, amount of time employees worked remotely, 
and issues experienced due to broadband service during the pandem
ic. This section also 
evaluated expected changes in broadband ad computer use over the next 12 months. This 
information provides valuable insight into demand for broadband service during the pandemic.
 
Internet Connection Speed
 
Before the Covid
-
19 pandemic,
 
more than four in 10 respondents (42%) thought their internet 
connection speed was fast enough for their needs, dropping to 35 percent during the Covid

19 
pandemic. Only 15% thought their internet connection speed was very slow and would like to be 
connec
ted at much higher speeds before the pandemic, while during the pandemic this number 
increased to 26% (see

Appendix G: Unserved 
Premises Suitable for Line Extensions
 
To identify premises suitable for line extensions (see Section 
8.2.2.2
), we used VT Public Service 
Department data to identify 
how many premises in each town are served by 25/3 or not. Using a 
GIS layer of existing residential cable plant and fiber plant, we ran a geospatial analysis to 
determine how many unserved premises were within half a mile, and then within a mile, of the 
ex
isting infrastructure. We then calculated how many unserved premises fell within that 
0
.5 mile 

within the same buffer. This allowed us to understand the number 
and density of unserved 
premises in every town that could be covered by building on roads within half a mile or a mile of 
existing plant. 
 
After running this calculation for every town, we then sorted towns by the percentage coverage 
of 25/3 service they a

that should be targeted would be found in towns with robust existing covers; a town with only 
50 percent coverage was likely to have large, contiguous unserved areas, whereas a town wit
h 
90
 
percent
 
coverage was less likely.
 
After removing the towns with 100 percent coverage, like Springfield, we arrived at a list of towns 
that were almost fully covered, but still had unserved premises within 0.5 or 1 mile of existing 
plant.
 
The 
table below 
lists the 39 towns with 
more than 
85 percent existing coverage, and with 
premises that according to the analysis could be served by line extensions. 
Maps following the 
table illustrate the unserved premises in the towns.

Protecting Against COVID

Providers should review their current Emergency Preparedness Plan to ensure it addresses 
infectious 
diseases.
 
 

 
The long
-
term care facility must have the development of arrangements with other LTC facilities 
and other providers to receive patients in the event of limitations or cessation of operations to 
maintain the continuity of services to f
acility patients.
 

 
Contact 
facilities with transfer agreements and ensure the agreement is still valid and include any 
outside sources of transportation.
 

 
Review the provision of subsistence needs for staff and patients whether they evacuate or shelter 
in pl
ace. Items to review can include:
 
o
 
Food 

 
Check on adequate supply and contact food suppliers to verify the agreement is still 
valid.
 
o
 
Water 

 
Check on the current supply in
-
house and on the water agreement with the vendor.
 
o
 
Medical and Pharmaceutical Supplies 

 
Take a current inventory and access the quantity 
required to remain on
-
hand and make arrangements to maintain that amount. 
 

 
Ensure a system of medical document that preserves patient information, protects confidentiali
ty of 
patient information, and secures and maintains availability of records.
 

 
The facility should ensure that medical records can be accessed in the event a resident is 
transferred to the hospital or another facility.
 
 
In a resident suspected case or a 
positive result for COVID
-
19
, there are many considerations for 
quarantine/isolation to include the physical make
-
up and mechanical systems
.
 
 
 
 
Choose a section of your building that would be easy to isolate and has limited traffic. An example 
would be a win
g or corridor that leads to the end of the building. The area should not require staff 
or residents to pass through for access to another part of the building.
 

 
The preference is to
 
utilize a set of cross corridor smoke or fire doors as the separation to th
e 
isolated area. Signs should be posted to alert staff and residents of the restricted access.
 

 
If the area is used for evacuation, ensure nothing inhibits the continued use in the event of an 
emergency.
 

 
A major concern is the HVAC (heating ventilation air 
c
onditioning) systems for the isolated area. 
Work with the maintenance staff and contractor to provide a complete understanding of the 
system.
 

 
Ensure the HVAC system does not include any return air from the resident rooms or corridor that 
recirculate to ot
her sections of the building. Pay special attention to facilities that utilize an open 
plenum return.
 

 
Verify the exhaust air from all restrooms are exhausted to the outside as required.
 

 
Identify a designated area to DON 
personal protective equipment (
PPE
)
 
and a separate area to 
DOFF PPE. Include a secured location to properly dispose of worn PPE.
 

 
Include room in
 
an
 
isolated area for any staff that may develop symptoms at work until the staff 
member can be safely transported out of the facility.
 

 
If available
,
 
alcohol
-
based hand sanitizer should be at the point of entry and 
the 
exit to the isolated 
area. If hand sanitizer is not, ensure a hand washing sink is available. Consider designating a room 
at the isolation point to use as a wash
-
up station.

:   The Indiana Department of Correction will manage infectious diseases in correctional 
facilit
ies th
rough comprehensive
 infec
tion control measures
 including
, but not limited
 to, identification of cases th
rough 
testing
 and
 screening
, education
 and
 tra
ining
, surve
illance, 
environmental and operationa
l management, 
and
 appropriate treatment
 plan
s. Each
 facil
ity must 
develop and i
mple
ment
 a plan
 that
 provides operational
, preven
tion and 
disease
 management
 guidance
. Plans
 should i
ncorporate 
staff training
 and
 education
 in regard to
 the
 spe
cific
 infectious
 disease
 and
 address
 the management 
of infected o
r poten
tially infected 
incarc
erate
d individuals
 , sta
ff, vo

, and visitors.  
  II. INTRODUCTION
:   Public safety is central to the mission of the Indiana Department of Correction. In the event 

of an infectious disease outbreak in a correctional facili
ty, th
e Ind
iana
 Dep
artment o
f Correction is 
to be 
prepared
 to promptly
 identify suspec
ted cases
, treat infected individuals
, and prevent the spread of disease
 all while protecting
 staff
 and incarcerated individuals
.    
Whenever a new or known illness occur
s and 
sprea
ds rapidly, it na
tura
lly 
can 
caus
e wo
rry, 
especially in rapidly evolvi
ng sit
uations when information is 
changing frequently. However, 
during the spread of an infectious disease, the 
department
 must stay informed and take steps 
to ensure readines
s. 
  
Most infectious disease
s spread
 via
 bodily 
fluids;
 thus
, primary prevention 
is key
 to stopping 
the spread of i
llness
. A vast
 number of 
incarcerated 
or detained
 persons (ID
PS) and staff 
could become infected if proper measures are not
 efficiently
 implem
ented 
to quickly identify 
infec
ted i
ndiv
iduals and interrupt the tran
smissi
on. Infectious disease can be mild to severe 
and can, 
at times, lead to death.

Introduction
 
This draft document 
is 
designed to assist Local Health Departments in planning for vaccine distribution
 
in response to the COVID
-
19 pandemic
. Information co
ntained in this document is based on limited and 
preliminary guidance from the Cent
er
s
 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
and
 
the 
Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and will be continuously updated as that guidance 
evolves. All infor
mation in this document is subject to change.
 
 
The 
Illinois Department of 
Public Health (
IDPH
)
 
Office of Health Protection (OHPt) Immunization Section 
and IDPH Office of Preparedness and Response (OPR) Medical Countermeasures Program led the 
collaborative 
efforts of the COVID
-
19 Vaccination 
Section 
in developing this 
State of Il
linois 
COVID
-
19 
Vaccination 
Plan
,
 
as an attachment to the Vaccination Annex of the State of Illinois Pandemic Plan. This 
plan
 
should be used by state and local 
partners to 
inform 
pla
n
ning
 
efforts for the administration of SARS
-
CoV
-
2/COVID
-
19 vaccine
s
.
 
IDPH will 
ensure quality improvement
 
by soliciting feedback from partners and 
stakeholders throughout the implementation of this plan and as new information
/guidance
 
becomes 
available.
 
T
he ID
PH/OPR Medical Countermeasures Program develops and maintains plans for request, receipt, 
distribution, mass dispensing and administration of life
-
saving emergency medical supplies and 
equipment during a disaster
,
 
where the public's health is at risk.
 
This
 
includes plans in response to human
-
caused and natural events. The Medical Countermeasures Program includes the Strategic National 
Stockpile (SNS) Program, the CHEMPACK Program, the Illinois Pharmaceutical Stockpile (IPS)
,
 
and the 
Cities Readiness In
itiat
ive (CRI). The SNS 
Program 
is a federal cache of emergency medical supplies and 
equipment that can be deployed to states during a disaster. The CHEMPACK
 
Program
 
is the forward 
placement of nerve agent antidotes. IPS is a state
-
owned cache of emergency
 
medi
cal supplies and 
equipment. CRI is a program designed to ensure cross
-
border collaboration of municipalities, counties, 
and states during incidents where emergency medical supplies and equipment are deployed.
 
The IDPH/OHPt Immunization Section maintai
ns th
e Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization 
Registry Exchange (I
-
CARE), a system for vaccine management and operations, which includes ordering, 
shipping, handling, and storing procedures for all vaccine purchases in the 
state
. 
 
T
his is a state
-
le
vel p
lan
;
 
however, the 
C
ity of Chicago will receive direct allocation 
of vaccine 
from the 
federal 
government. IDPH 
has 
work
ed
 
with CDPH to ensure 
both the state
-
 
and 
city
-
level plans
 
are 
in sync
 
and 
comple
mentary
. 
 
To accomplish the 
goal
 
of providing SARS
-
CoV
-
2/COVID
-
19 vaccine
s
 
to enough of the population to 
elicit
 
he
rd
 
immunity
,
 
as supply of vaccines permits,
 
the State of Illinois will
 
accomplish the following
:
 

 
Provide technical assistance to 
Local Health Department
s 
(LHDs) 
to inform lo
cal planning
 
and 
en
sure 
local plans 
align
 
with state plans
 
and/or 
guidance
 
a
nd 
maintain 
accountability
.
 

 
Closely monitor activities at the local level to ensure the COVID
-
19 vaccine administration 
plan is implemented throughout 
each local 
jurisdiction in ad
herence with federa
l 
and state 
guidance and requirements
,
 
and that there is equitable access to COVID
-
19 vaccination across 
the state.
 

 
Activate the
 
State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) to coordinate 
operations
 
and tracking 
of the SARS
-
CoV
-
2/COVID
-
19 va
ccine
 
administratio
n
 
in the state.
 
 9
 

 
Ensure expanded scopes of practice for healthcare licenses
 
as necessary
,
 
to allow certain 
medical professionals the opportunity to assist in the
 
vaccination campaign when working 
under the authority of the local public health jurisdiction o
r a healthcare entity. 
 

 
Provide a statewide system for tracking vaccine administration and for notifying clients of the 
need for a second dose of the vaccine
,
 
if
 
a second dose 
is indicated
.
 

 
Provide a statewide system for volunteer management and tracking
, 
i.e., 
Illinois Helps.
 

 
Provide a statewide system for disseminating information to vaccine providers and other
s
 
with direct involvement in the COVID
-
19
 
vaccinatio
n administration mission
, i.e., 
Health Alert 
Network

HAN/SIREN. 
 

 
Provide oversight of provider 
enrollment, tracking, and vaccine location.
 

 
Identify and map priority populations and determine sub
-
allocations of vaccine for 
distribution within the state. 
 

 
Tr
ack relevant data to inform the statewide vaccination strategy and ensure 
federal 
requirements 
are met.
 

 
Provide guidance and 
training to vaccine providers
 
on
 
the following
: 
 
o
 
Available
 
CDC r
esources and vaccine recommendations
.
 
o
 
Ordering and receiving the COVID
-
19 vaccine
.
 
o
 
Vaccine stor
age and handling, including transportation requirements, specific to COVID
-
19 vaccine

l 
requirements, guidelines
,
 
or policies.
 
o
 
Policies on encouraging vaccination and alleviating an
xieties, hesitation
s,
 
or fears of 
COVID
-
19 vaccination
,
 
in order to achieve the best outcomes. 
 

 
Collaborate with local Public Information Officers (PIOs) to conduct a statewide media 
campaign to share facts about the vaccine and to encourage 
residents
 
to b
e vaccinated.

are assumed susceptible to the virus.
 
Initial populations prioritized for COVID

based on federal guidance
 
and 
subject to change b
ased 
on ACIP guidance:

(Note: On May 12, 2021, the CDC 
a
dopt
ed the 
recommendation of ACIP to expand 
use of 
the Pfizer vaccine for those 
12 
years
 
and older)
 
o
 
Recommendations for groups 
on whic
h 
to 
focus 
will likely change after vaccine is 
available, depending on characteristics of each vaccine, vaccine supply, and disease 
epidemiology.
 
o
 
Because of the uncertainty of COVID
-
19 vaccine production, plans
 
must be flexible and 
should include 
high
-
dema
nd and 
low
-
demand scenarios.
 

 
Vaccination
 
o
 
Vaccination will be voluntary.
 
o
 
Adequate federal funding will be available to implement a large
-
scale vaccination 
response.
 
o
 
Initial doses of COVID
-
19 vaccine may be autho
rized for use under an EUA issued by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on available safety and efficacy data.
 
o
 
Cold
-
chain storage and handling requirements for each COVID
-
19 vaccine product will 
vary from refrigerated (2°C
 
to 
8°C) to frozen (

.
 
o
 
As of the date o
f this plan, 
COVID
-
19 vaccines are availa
ble in single dose or two do
se 
increments depending on the type of vaccine administered.
 
o
 
COVID
-
19 v
accines that require t
wo doses
,
 
separated by 
approximately 
21 or 28 days
,
 
will 
be needed for immunity for some vacci
ne candidates
. 
Both
 
doses of the vaccine 
will be 
with the same vaccine type, produced by the same manufacturer, but not the same lot of 
the vaccine. This will require stringent tracking of vaccine administered and patient 
reminders.
 
o
 
Per CDC 
guidance
, 
the 
v
accine should be provided to enough of th
e population to elicit 
herd
 
immunity as supply of vaccines permits.
 
 12
 
o
 
Vaccination will take place over many months and 
be 
provided
 
in phases as more vaccine 
becomes available.
 
o
 
Vaccine
 
administration planning must refl
ect the four types of vaccines being 
manufactured:
 

 
mRNA
 
or m
essenger ribonucleic acid
: Encodes the 
protein of the virus
,
 
which is 
inserted into cells to trigg
er an immune response and create anti
bodies to the virus.
 

 
Nonreplicating 
V
ector
: Only 
certain proteins of the virus
 
are administered
 
to stimulate 
the imm
une system. Uses a harmless viral vec
tor to deliver the protein into the cells.
 

 
Protein 
A
djuvant
: 
V
irus protein is packaged into a nanoparticle and delivered into cells 
with an adjuvant to enhance the immune response.
 

 
Live 
A
ttenuated
: The virus is modified
 
to be inactive but 
is 
still alive. 
T
he v
irus can infect 
the cells but not replicate to cause disease.
 
o
 
CDC will provide standard communication materials on the EUA for the general public
,
 
similar to the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) and specific comm
unication to vaccine 
providers on the
 
EUA.
 
o
 
Monitoring for adverse events will be 
necessary
 
and important
.
 
o
 
Vaccine distribution for common vaccine
-
preventable diseases will not alter from routine 
procedures.
 
o
 
Seasonal influenza vaccine production and campaig
n will continue.
 
o
 
Demand for the pande
mic vaccine 
may
 
be high throughout the response.
 
o
 
Providers will follow state 
and
 
CDC guidance by 
vaccinating 
within the given phase.
 
o
 
Steps will be taken to minimize vaccine wastage.
 
Requirements for COVID
-
19 vaccine adm
inistration will continue to 
evolve over time
.
 
Additional 
guidance 
may be
 
forthcoming 
pending ACIP recommendations.

Section 2: COVID
-
19 Organizational Structure and Partner Involvement
 

-
19 response is organized under the Incident Command Sys
tem (ICS) (see organizational
 
chart in 
Figure 
2
). 
With IDPH as the lead agency, t
he Director of IDPH and the Director of the Illinois 
Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) operate under a Unified Comm
and Response. The IDPH response 
is
 
led by the Incident and Deputy Incident Commanders. In 
Figure 
2
, functions that interface with IEMA 
are 
signified
 
in red boxes. For V
accination, this is led under the Vaccination Section, which is led by a 
Section Chief and Deputy
. There are functions that interface with local jurisdictions at both the command 
staff and 
general staff
 
levels
. 
 
Within the Vaccination Section, each box re
presents a function that has a lead and support staff, as 
required, thus creating redundancy. Thi
s core team works in tandem with 
all stakeholders 
from across the 
state
 
and federal government
. The Vaccination Section
 
frequently holds ad hoc meetings and/or webinars 
to engage partners such as LHDs, 
state/local
 
Emergency Management Agencies (EMAs), priv
ate industry, 
associations, pharmacies, correctional facilities, and institutes of higher learning.

Pandemic vaccination planning is a combined state and local responsibili
ty that requires close 
collaboration
 
and coordination
 
among 
public health
 
entities
, external agencies, and community
 
partners. 
An internal COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program planning and coordination team is critical to ensure 
that 
the 
response
 
and vaccination o
perations
 
to COVID
-
19 is thoughtfully planned and successfully executed.
 
 
 14
 
Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID
-
19 Vac
cination
 
Due to changing vaccine supply levels at various points during the COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program, 
planning 
will
 
be flexible but as s
pecific as possible to accommodate a variety of scenarios. 
It is
 
anticipate
d
 
that 
vaccine supply will be limited 
ini
tially
, so the allocation of doses must consider vaccination providers 
and settings for vaccination of limited critical populations. The vac
cine supply is projected to increase 
quickly, allowing vaccination efforts to be expanded to include additional crit
ical populations and the 
general public. Additionally, recommendations on the various population groups for initial doses of 
vaccine could c

supply, disease epidemiology,
 
and local community factors.
 
Initially, 
IDPH 
utilized
 
the
 
recommendations from
 
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and 

 
(
NASEM)
 
A Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID
-
19 Vaccine
 
to inform the phased 
approach, 
before ACIP had released their recommendations. 
This 
framework 
focuses on 
reducing severe 
morbidity and 
mortality
 
and negative societal impact due to the transmission of SARS
-
CoV
-
2.
 
Emphasized 
in the framework is that the goal of the 
COVID
-
19 vaccination 
program is to vaccinate all those who choose 
to be vaccinated and who 
do not have medical contraindicatio
ns to the
 
vaccine.
 
Once ACIP released their 
recommendations, the 
COVID
-
19 Community Vulnerability Index (
CCVI
)
 
was then leveraged 
to 
ensure an 
equity lens was utilized in vaccine allocation
 
to pharmacies and other partners to provide vaccine access 
to hard
-
to
-
reach
 
communities.
 
The following explains the 
phased approach per CDC and ACIP guidance
, which 
are 
recommended based 

,
 

 
F
urther ACIP recommendations 
were provided
 
after the 
issuance 
of 
the
 
EUA
 
for vaccine candidat
es
, which
 
alter
ed
 
the phased approach by adding phases 
and/
or 
shifting populations from phase to phase.

phase

are 
available. 
I
nitial efforts 
focus 
on reaching critical populations. Ensure vaccination locations selected can reach 
populations, manage cold
-
chain requirements, and meet reporting requirements for vaccine 
supply and upt
ake. 
Vaccine admin
istration strategies in 
Phase 
1 
are divided 
into 
three

The f
ocus 
is 
on ensuring access to vaccine 
for 
all populations 
1
2
 
years of age 
and 
older
.
 

 
(Note: As of the date of this
 
plan, only 
Pfizer
 
has been authorized for those ages 
1
2
 
years 
and 
older
, whereas 
Moderna
 
and 
J
ohnson & Johnso
n
 
were authorized for those ages 18 
years 
and 
up.)
 
As 
the state
 
progresses 
through each phase, the IDPH 
V
accin
a
tion 
S
ection
 
will 
conduct
 
planning to 
address
 
the next 
priority 
population
.
 
I
DPH 
aims
 
to achieve the overarching goal of
 
h
erd immunity
 
for the 
state
.
 
 
Jurisdictions and providers should also employ strategies for ensuring equitable administration of 
vaccin
es within the identified priority groups to communities hardest hit by COVID
-
19, such
 
as low
-
income populations and communities and essential workers of color.
 
IDPH will continue to monitor 
COVID
-
19 vaccine orders by assessing ordering reports supplied by 
the immunization program
.
 
IDPH will 
also 
monitor vaccine uptake and coverage and 
reassess
 
s
trategies to increase
 
uptake in populations 
and/or communities 
with 
low 
vaccine 
coverage
. IDPH will
 
use
 
vaccine wastage reports provided to
 
minimize 
waste. 
In
 
situat
ion
s
 
where
 
there 
is low COVID
-
19 vaccine demand
,
 
and as 
vaccine supply 
transitions
 
from scarce to ample
, jurisdictions should monitor their supply and adjust strategies to
 
avoid 
vaccine wast
e
 
and 
protect the v
aluable resource
.
 
Examples of this could be
 
LHD
s creating a stand
-
by list
 
of people to contact
 
in order to avoid vaccine waste
 
or increasing outreach with community 
organizations to identify underserved populations that are eligible for vaccines but have not ye
t had 
access to vaccine
.
 
As of the SIREN d
ated May 11, 2021
,
 
with up
dated guidance from IDPH & the CDC,
 
providers 
should 
make every effort to vaccinate 
all 
eligible persons who present at vaccination locations. 
If 
providers
 
need to puncture a multi
-
dose vial to administer 
vaccine 
to 
only 
one or 
a 
couple of
 
patients, 
the provider should. Ultimately, the provider may need to waste some or all remaining doses in that vial; 
but at this 
stage
 
in the pandemic response, it is critical that opportunities to vaccinate are not missed
. 
Finally, IDPH will prov
ide COVID
-
19 vaccine administration reports to CDC as requested.
 
 
 

 
including estimate population numbers
.

Section 4: Critical
 
Populations
 
The 
CDC established an ACIP work group to review evidence on COVID
-
19 epidemiology and burden
,
 
vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy, evidence quality, and implementation issues to inform recommendations 
for
 
a
 
COVID
-
19 vaccination policy.
 
 
Initiall
y, IDPH utilized the recommendations from
 
NASEM 
to 
ensure 
equity
 
and i
nform the phased approach, before ACIP had released their recommendations. Once A
CIP 
released their recommendations, the COVID
-
19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) was then leveraged 
to
 
ensure an equity lens was utilized in vaccine allocation
 
to pharmacies and other partners to provide 
vaccine access to hard
-
to
-
reach communities. 
Th
e priority populations listed below 
are 
for planning 
purposes
 
and are subject to change as more is learned 
about the effects of
 
COVID
-
19
 
and
 
the 
effectiveness 
of vaccines in different populations and 
as further 
federal guidance
 
may be issued
.
 
All residents
 
of Illinois, 
regardless of citizenship status, should have the opportunity to receive the vaccine, if they
 
so choose, free 
of charge.
 
 
Ariadne Labs
 
and 
the Surgo Foundation 
have 
developed a
 
free
 
Vaccine Allocation Planner for COVID
-
19
, 
which pulls data for each of the critical populations
 
from various federal
,
 
state
, and other
 
datas
ets.
 
The 
methodology for these allocation calculations can
 
be found 
in that planning document
.
 
The State of
 
Illinois 
utilized
 
this tool 
for planning and 
to inform critical population sizes.
 
IDPH will 
continually review additional guidance provided by the f
ederal government and updates to ACIP 
recommendations
 
rega
rding
 
allocation priorities and the populations that will be 
served
 
successively as 
vaccine supplies increase. Among the factors that IDPH is expecting to consider are health disparities and 
other h
ealth
-
access issues
,
 
individuals at higher risk (e.g., eld
erly and those with underlying health 
conditions)
,
 
occupations at higher risk (e.g., 
healthcare
 
personnel
 
and 
essential
 
industries)
,
 
populations 
at higher risk (e.g., racial and ethnic groups, incar
cerated individuals,
 
homebound individuals
,
 
and 
residents of nursing homes)
,
 

for vaccine prioritization will reflect recommendations set f
orth by 
ACIP 
with minimal changes. IDPH 
recognizes
 
the potential for alterations of these recommendations based on the 
evolving epidemiology of 
COVID
-
19 and will monitor national recommendations for changes that may occur.
 
 
After the target 
priority groups
 
have been vaccinated and additional vaccine stocks become available, 
IDPH will ensure that communities suffering dispr
oportionately from COVID
-
19

including communities 
of color, older adults, people with disabilities, and people with comorbidities

are pri
oritized 
appropriately for vaccination. IDPH will work with local community partners and providers to strategically 
pro
vide vaccine access
 
to 
underserved populations for vaccinations
 
within the priority groups
. 
Community 
partners could include 
community
-
based organizatio
ns
 
(CBOs) or 
social service organizations, faith
-
based 
organizations
, YMCAs/YWCAs, fraternities
/sororities
, school organizations
, meal de
livery services, or 
senior centers. 
I
DPH will phase
-
in vaccination for the remainder of the population based on age or 
other 
criteria to ensure fair, equitable, and orderly distribution.
 
Prioritization of Vaccine Allocation and Administration
 
Local public 
health jurisdictions should plan to collaborate with their regional 
healthcare
 
coalition, 
hospitals, long
-
term care
 
and
/
or 
assisted living facilities, and other potential vaccine providers that 
serve 
frontline 
essential 
workers in their jurisdiction to ens
ure full coverage of vaccine first to the designated 
priority groups and 
then 
to the general public.
 
LHD
s should re
ach out
 
to these groups 
immediately
 
to 
determine number, type, and location of each priority group in the public health jurisdiction. 
LHD
s sh
ould 
 17
 
coordinate with their 
healthcare
 
coalition, emergency management, and other response partners to 
develop a lis
t of entities serving priority groups, determine their capabilities to serve as sites for vaccine 
administration
 
(
i.e.
,
 
closed
 
P
oints of 
Disp
ensing
 
[
PODs
]
)
, or develop plans for the 
LHD
 
to service these 
groups at a general POD designed for these groups.
 
 
D

success. 

 
was to
 
enroll LHDs. 
Enrollment then expand
ed
 
to include hospitals i
n the state so that they may 
provide vaccine to qualifying 
staff. 
After hospitals, 
IDPH
 
focus
ed
 
on Federally
 
Qualified Health Centers
 
(FQHCs)
 
and 
pharmacies, 
especially those in 
rural areas
 
that do not have hospitals or other opportunities to access vaccines outside 
of the health departments. By enrolling
 
these pharmacies, 
IDPH
 
is 
able to provide vaccine 
access 
to many 
priority patients. 
In coordination with
 
LHDs, t
he State 
of Illinois 
will also 
support the 
deploy
ment
 
of mobile
 
vaccination teams able to conduct on
-
site vaccination events for populations th
at may not have ready 
access to another vaccine provider. Once hospitals and pharmacies 
are
 
on
-
boarded, 
I
DPH
 
will begin 
focusing
 
on 
urgent care clinics, and community providers that will be able to reach additional individuals 
within these priority populations, as well as other private medical providers. Geographic 
I
nformation 
S
ystem (GIS) mapping will be 
us
e
d
 
to identify gaps in cover
age
,
 
and targeted recruitment efforts will be 
implemented to fill those gaps.
 
IDPH will use an electronic database to enter newly enrolled providers 
and 
update it 
daily
 
and submit it 
to the CDC.
 
Visit the hyperlink for informatio
n on 
vaccination locations in

workers in their jurisdiction to 
ensure full coverage of vaccine first to designated prior
ity groups and 
then
 
to the general 
public
, as outlined in Section 4: Critical Populations. 
 

 
All entities must provide 
training to staff
 
as

Section 6: COVID
-
19 Vaccine Administration Capacity
 
With
 
the assistance of numerous state agencies and professional or
ganizations
,
 
IDPH is recruiting and 
enrolling COVID
-
19 vaccination providers
. These providers will vary in types and settings to address each 
of the previously described phases of vaccine availability.
 
IDPH will use 
GIS mapping to identify the locations of organizations 
expressing
 
initial interest in becom
ing 
COVID
-
19
 
vaccine providers. Additionally, 
IDPH will use 
maps 
to
 
indicate populations with 
a 
higher 
prevalence of conditions or circumstances that increase the ri
sk of significant morbidity and mortality 
from COVID
-
19. Particular attention will be paid 
to those identified areas to ensure vaccine providers are 
recruited in those geographic areas in sufficient number
s
 
to vaccinate at
-
risk populations. This will allow
 
the planning team to visualize gaps in access and recruit providers in specific regions. 
 
I
nitial onboarding 
will focus 
on
 
LHD
s
 
and 
all
 
hospitals, with priority
 
given
 
to those with emergency 
departments and/or intensive care units. 
 
Local pharmacies will 
be 
us
ed
 
to
 
provide expanded access to a variety of communities. Pharmacists are 
not only hi
ghly accessible, but they are also commonly available for longer hours and 
for 
more days than 
non
-
pharmacy providers.

State 
of Illinois
 
were enrolled in
 
the
 
Federal Retail Pharmacy Pa

established by CDC 
and 
selected

Illinois Helps
 
to 
search for qualified volunteers.
 

 
Illinois Helps (
www.illinoishelps.net
) is a s
tate registry of volunteers for both medical and non
-
medical occupations who can be 
requested 
in a disaster or public he
alth emergency.
 

 
Thirty
-
eight 
states use a platform similar to 
Illinois Helps
,
 
built on the federal standard 
Emergency System for Advance
 
Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR
-
VHP).
 

 
Illinois Helps is a decentralized system whereby each organi
zation (
e.g., 
LHD
, hospital, Medical 
Reserve Corps
 
[MRC]
, 
long
-
term care facilit
y
) manages individual volunteers 
who
 
wish to work 
with t
hat specific organization.
 

 
A volunteer 
registers in
 
the system, gives 
his or her 
information 
(
including licensure and sk
ills
)
, 
and 
chooses from up
 
to 15 organizations 
with which 
to work.
 

 
The organization using the volunteer follows 
its 
own protocols, including background checks, 
if appropriate
, to onboard the volunteer
.
 

 
This is not an event
-
based system but rather a holisti
c volunteerism program whereby each 
organization works with volunte
ers in a variety of ways.
 

 
Approximately 270 qualifying organizations, 
including 
LH
D
s, 
MRC
, hospitals, and long
-
term 
care facilities are registered in Illinois Helps to request volunteers.

The Illinois National Guard (ILNG) Mass Vaccination Augmentation 
Team (MVAT)
 
is capable of augmenting 
county public mass vaccination operations or deployable as a standalone package for remote vaccination
, 
established under the 
oversight
 
of Local H
ealth De
partment.  Based on operational requirements, these 
teams can either operate individually with assistance from a health department, augment existing 
 28
 
vaccination efforts, or multiple teams can deploy to a single location to provide 
mass 
vaccination 
surge 
ca
pability. During the initial phases of 
state vaccination
 
operation
s
, the ILNG has the capability to deploy
 
25 teams of
 
military personnel and medics providing up to 47,250 vaccinations per week. 
As operations 
continue, the ILNG has the capability t
o activa
te another 75 teams, augmented with contract medical 
personnel, to provide an additional capacity of 141,750 vaccinations a week. 
Oversight to the distribution 
of these resources
 
across the state are made by the
 
Illinois Department 
of 
Public Health
 
in collaboration 
with other state partners 
and take direct orders from the Governor of Illinois

mission will be evolving over the course of the vaccination program 
and 
is 
tailored to best serve 
the 
residents
 
of Illinois
, such as ILNG mobile missions in rural counties across the state
.
 
 
Large
 
Vaccination Sites
 
As vaccine supply increases, 
large
 
vaccination sites will be 
established 
in northern, central, and southern 
I
llin
ois. These sites will be fixed and strategically located to equitably serv
e all populations
 
as efficiently 
as po

. 
T
he 
Vaccine 
Tracking System 
(VTrckS)
 
is a secure,

based 
information technology system that integrates the entire
 
publicly
 
funded vaccine supply chain
 
from purchasing and ordering through distribution to participating
 
state, 
local, and territorial health d
epartments and healthcare providers. 
However, th
is timeframe is dependent 
on vaccine availability and on McKesson and the vaccine manufacturer

s
 
ability
 
to meet this timeline.
 
On initial distribution, Illinois will activate the State Emergency Operations C
enter (SEOC) to support and 
monitor distribution
 
of the vaccine. To ensure success of the mission, 
ICS
 
may
 
be expanded 
as needed, 
to

include
 
but not
 
be
 
limited to,
 
the following positions:
 

 
The IDPH Immunization Group is the lead for processing and
 
approving vaccine orders in I
-
CARE. The Immuniz
ation Group will also be responsible for monitoring patient tracking and 
for monitoring adverse events reporting. This group is headed by the Vaccines for Children 
Administrator and staff.
 

 
The Vaccine Adminis
tration Division is responsible for liaising wit

Vaccine Allocation
 
The federal government will determine the amount of COVID

19 vaccine designated for each 
state
. Using 
this 
allocation
, 
I
DPH will manag
e
 
and approv
e
 
orders from enrolled 
COVID

19 vaccine 
providers
.
 
During 
initial 
rollout
 
when vaccine is scarce, LHDs 
will 
determine the allocation
s 
for t
he
ir
 
jurisdiction 
based on 
their 
local 
vaccination plan
. 
The amount 
allocated
 
will change over time and may be based on critical 
populations recommended for vaccinatio
n, COVID
-
19 vaccine pro
duction and availability, and overall 
population of the jurisdiction.
 
Federal agencies and additional commercial partners will also receive 
allocations directly from 
the 
CDC once larger volumes of vaccine are available. The CDC is cu
rrently 
developing proc
edures to ensure that jurisdictions have full visibility 
into
 
COVID
-
19 vaccine supply and 
vaccination activities among these entities located within their boundaries. 
Local 
Health Departments
 
should plan outreach to their regional

althcare
 
coalition, hos
pitals, long

term care/assisted living 

capacity to order and receive vaccine to assist with vaccination operations for their 
pop
ulation
.
 

 
IDPH will esti
mate overall allocations of COVID
-
19 vaccine based on 
the size of critical 
population 
groups
 
within each 
local public health 

jurisdiction
 
for Phase 1
A
, and 
then total population from Phase 1
B
 
forward

The City of Chicago
 
will receive a

Jurisdictions should anticipate that allocation strategies may shift during the response based 
on supply, demand, and needs

within the state.
 

 
The following federal entities will receive direct allo
cation of COVID

19 vaccines
 
from 
the 
CDC
: 
T
he
 
Federal Bureau of Prisons, 
U.S. 
Department of Defense, 
the U.S. 
Department of State, 
the 
U.S. Department of 
Veterans 
Affairs
, and 
the 
Indian Health Service. Federal agencies are 
planning to implement ACIP 
recom

and distribution.
 
Vaccine allocation to these federal entities will not count against a 

 
Federal agencies that are involved in the response but not 
listed ab

are
 
included 
in the plans for vaccination.
 

 
In addition to the federal entities receiving vaccine directly from the federal government, 
pharmacies participating in the Federal Retail 
Pharm
acy Partnership Program will receive 
vaccine directly from the federal government in addition to the 
s

will be the first pharmacy to receive this additional federally
 
allocated vaccine, and more 
pharmacies will be added as 
vacci

 36
 
full activation of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, Illinois will transfer a portion of the 

 
as
 
required by the CDC
 
and direct allocations to 
a
reas 
identified as more vulnerable through the COVID

19 Community Vulnerability Index 
(CCVI).
 
 
Vaccine 
Arrival 
and
 
Distribution
 
All providers must have plans in place to receive vaccine and ancillary supplies shipped directly to the 
designated sites
 
and a 
centr
alized distribution of vaccine
,
 

will be 
submitted to IDPH for review to ensure 
it is
 
in line with the state strategy
 
and 
to identify additional 
opportunities for technical assistance to provide to the 
LHD
s
.
 
Pla

requirements for storage and handling of the different types of vaccines.
 
Providers willing to administer 
the vaccine continue to be enrolled in the 
Immunization Information System (
IIS
)
 
and agree to 
requirements for
 
receiving, 
storing, administering, and tracking vaccine administration. Enrolled providers 
will place orders for the vaccine with the state immunization program. 
(See Section 11 for more details.) 
The CDC is expected to provide each state an allocation of
 
vaccine bas
ed on population, and states can 
prioritize and fill orders against those 
allocations
. Orders are then sent to the CDC and vaccines will be 
shipped directly to the provider through a centralized vaccine distributor.

Inventory Management
 
COVID

19 vaccination providers will be required to report 
daily 
inventory of COVID

19 vaccines in
 
VaccineFinder.
 
Additional doses gained from vaccine vials should also be reported in I

CARE
 
to ensure 
inventory i
s
 
increased to account for additional doses d
rawn from vaccine vials
 
(as of the date of this plan, 
the CDC has only approved the use of extra 
doses from Pfizer & Moderna vials)
.
 
From this data, 
IDPH will 
maintain on a real
-
time basis a database inventory of each dose of vaccine that is shipped from t
he 
manufacturer or distributor and received at each ship
-
to site. Ship
-
to sites will maintain on 
a real
-
time 
basis an inventory of vaccine in stock, manufacturer
 
name
, lot numbers, expiration dates for each lot, and 
a record of each dose of vaccine transfe
rred to any clinics designated to conduct the vaccination clinics.
 
In order to minimize the numbe
r of unused expired doses and manage expired doses correctly, 
CDC
 
encourage
s
 
jurisdictions and providers to:
 

 
Monitor expiration dates weekly, rotate stock as n

to manage inventory
.

Based on the latest 
expiration information, REMO
VE expired vaccine from the storage unit 
IMMEDIATELY. Do not give staff opportunity to administer
 
expired vaccine
.
 
o
 
If expired vaccine is in
advertently administered, it is considered a vaccine administration 
error and requires remediation including a 
VAERS 
report, contacting the recipient to 
inform them of the error, and may or may not require 
revaccin
ation based on the 

Appendix A of the 
Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of

Additional 
D
oses
 
According to the 
FDA,
 
t
he 
Pfizer vaccine
 
comes in 
multidose 
6
-
dose 
vials. 
V
ials of Pfizer COVID
-
19 Vaccine 
may
 
contain
 
6 or 7
 
doses 
dependent on the type of syringe being utilized
. 
Additionally
, Moderna 
may 
also 
have 10 or 11 dos
es
 
dependent on the type of syringe being utilized.
 
As
 
of
 
March 31, 
2021
, per the 
HCP 
Fact Sheet
, 
there is a 
new maximum 15
-
dose vial presentation with ranges
 
for the Moderna vaccine
 
(see 
table atta
ched to hyperlink)
. Depending on the 
syringes and needles used for each dose, there may not 
be sufficient volume to extract more than 10 doses from the maximum 
11
-
dose vial or more than 1
4
 
doses 
from the maximum 
15
-
d
ose vial. Irrespective of the type of sy
ringe 
and needle, each dose must contain 
0.5 m
L of
 
vaccine. Do 
not 
pool excess vaccine from multiple vials
. Pierce the stopper at a different site 
each time.

If the amount remaining in the vial, after the 
6
 
doses
 
(Pfizer) or 10
 
up to
 
15
 
doses (Moderna)
, is 
enough for additional full doses, it may be utilized.
 

 
If the amount of vacc
ine remaining in the vial cannot provide a ful
l dose, discard the vial in a 
sharps container and waste any excess volume. 
 

 
As of the date of this plan, the CDC 
has
 
not 
authorized 
the use of additional doses of

Section 8: COVI
D
-
19 Vaccine Storage and Handling
 
COVID
-
19 vaccine products are temperature
-
sensitive and must 
be stored and handled correctly to ensure 
efficacy and maximize shelf life. Proper storage and handling practices are critical to minimize vaccine loss 
and limit
 
risk of administering COVID
-
19 vaccine with reduced effectiveness. Jurisdictions should work 
w
ith staff at each COVID
-
19 vaccination provider site to ensure appropriate vaccine storage and handling 
procedures are established and followed
, specific to each
 
vaccine (
Pfizer
, 
Moderna
, and 
J
ohnson & 
Johnso
n
)
.
 
Providers need to provide 
refrigerator and/or 
freezer certificates to the 
IDPH Immunization 
Program
. Additionally
, provid
ers must review data
-
logging equipment logs regularly and upload them to 
I
-
CARE to validate compliance. Providers must also record the minimum
 
and the 
maximum 
temperature 
in the morning and the temperature once in the afternoon. Providers must uplo
ad tempe
rature logs into 
the IIS
,
 
and IDPH will only allow sites to order vaccines if they can guarantee appropriate temperature
s
 
are 
maintained.
 
IDPH and CDC 
requirements will be shared with providers during the enrollment proces
s. 
See 

Quick Reference Guide for Healthcare Professionals
 
for
 
basic information on
 
proper
 
storage, 
preparation, and administration
 
of the currently authorized COVI
D
-
19 vac
cine products in the 
United 
States.
 
It is expected that cold
 
chain storage and handling requirements for COVID
-
19 vaccine products will vary 
in temperature from refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) to frozen (
-
15°
C
 
to 
-
25°C) to 
ultra
-
cold
 
(
-
60°C to 
-
80°C
)
 
in 
the free
zer or within 
a 
dry
 
ice shipping container. 
(Note: Pfizer
 
450 doses 
trays 
will be packed on dry ice, 
but will 
not 
include dry ice replenishment.) 
Ongoing stability testing may 
affect 
these requirements.
 
The cold chain begins at
 
the COVID
-
19 vaccine manufac
turing plant, includes delivery to and storage at 
the COVID
-
19 vaccination provider site, and ends with administration of COVID
-
19 vaccine to a person. 
Jurisdictions and vaccination providers are responsible for maintaining vac
cine quality from the time a 
 46
 
shipment arrives at a vaccination provider site until the dose is administered. IDPH will minimize 
opportunities for breaks in the cold chain. 
The majority of
 
COVID
-

centralized distributo
r directly to the location wh
ere the vaccine will be stored and administered, although 
some vaccine
, such as initial shipments of ultra
-
cold vaccine, will 
be 

and
 

 
within the 
S
tate of Illinois
.
 
IDPH 
has
 
a m

unplanned 

adherence
 
to all cold
 
chain 
requirements
,
 
including 
ultra
-
cold
 
storage capacity.
 
P
roviders 
should 
us
e the entire
 
first
 
dose allocation
 
and 
not
 
hold 
back 
first dose 
va
ccine for a second 
dose
, 
as the second dose will be provided closer to the time of its expected administration
 
by the Federal 
Government
, per CDC guidance.
 
When notified second doses are available for order, 
only order second 
doses when they can be adminis
tered to ensure they are not held for long periods of time.
 
Satellite, Temporary, and Off
-
S
ite 
Clinics
:
 
Satellite, temporary, and off
-
site vaccination clinics play an important role in improving vaccination 
c
overage rates and vaccinating hard
-
to
-
reach popu
lations. 
Providers 
are encouraged to discuss and 
coordinate these clinics with their 
LHD
s.
 
Vaccination clinics held in these settings have unique challenges
,
 
and providers must follow specific guidelines 
p
rov
ided by 
the 
CDC 
for managing publicly supplied v
accine 
in these nontraditional settings. IDPH 
has procured
 
ultra
-
cold
 
storage 
freezers
, which will be 
us
ed for 
centralized distribution of ultra
-
cold vaccine and can also act as contingency should 
ultra
-
cold vaccines 
need to be stored
.
 
To better assist wit
h this situation, the following will be required:
 

 
The quantity of COVID
-
19 vaccine transported to a satellite, temporary, or off
-
site COVID
-
19 
vaccination clinic will be based on the anticipated nu
mber of COVID
-
19 vaccine recipients and 
the ability of the 
vaccination provider to store, handle, and possibly transport the vaccine 
appropriately. This is essential to minimizing vaccine wastage and spoilage.
 

 
COVID
-
19 vaccines may be transported

not shipp
ed

to a satellite, temporary, or off
-
site 
COVID
-
19 vaccinat
ion clinic setting using vaccine transportation procedures outlined in the 
COVID
-
19 addendum to 

ge and Handling Toolkit
. The procedures will 
include transp
orting vaccines to and from the provider site at appropriate temperatures, 
using appropriate equipment, 
and
 
monitoring and documenting temperatures.

Upon arrival at 
a 
CO
VID

maintain appropriate temperature throughout the clinic day.
 

 
Temperature data must be reviewed and documented according to guidance in the upcoming 
COVID

19 addendum to 

.
 

 
At the end of the clinic day, temperature data must be assessed prior to returning vaccine to 
fixed storage units to prevent administration of vaccin
es that may have been compromised.
 

 
As with all vaccines, if
 
COVID
-
19 vaccines are exposed to temperature excursions at any time, 
the temperature excursion should be documented, reported, and acted upon according to 

 
Th
e vaccine should be segregated until cleared for 
use by the
 
manufacturer or the CDC.

Unplanned 
Vaccine Repositioning
 
Before movement of any vaccine
 
for redistr
ibution
, providers must submit a request to the immunization 
program
 
by filling 
out 
the 
I
-
CARE Redi
stribution Form
 
(
this digital form is also 
available in Appendix B
 
as a 
li
nk
)
 
and contact their LHD
.
 
The
 
program will provide the CDC redistribution form to the site. Before the 
approval of the movement of vaccines, cold
 
chain management must be secured.
 
I
DPH will follow existing 
VFC Program protocols to coordinate the safe tran
sfer of vaccine in situations of unplanned repositioning. 
Providers are expected to contact 
program 
staff in the event unplanned repositioning is necessary to 
prevent 
the waste
 
of va
ccine. All COVID
-
19 vaccine transfers will be conducted with the assistanc
e of IDPH 
staff. DDLs 
will always remain with the vaccine
 
before, during, and after the transfer. DDL reports will be 
evaluated for temperature excursions
 
prior to vaccine transport
 
and
 
after transport to the receiving 
facility is completed
 
(See Figure #

.
 
Temperature 
Excursion Reporting
 
Cold
 
chain maintenance at individual provider locations will require appropriate vaccine storage and 
temperature
-
monitoring equipment, trained provider staff, and consistent, ac
curate inventory 
management as discussed
 
above
. All enrolled providers will be required to report temperature excursions 
by the next business day to IDPH. Providers are also expect
ed to label vaccine that has undergone a 


determined by the 
program
. Staff will be assigned to handle incoming temperature excursions per 
program protocol
s, and support will be provided by the immunization field staff 
should
 
the s
ituation 
require assistance. 
Providers
 
that fail to report temperature excursions within 
1
 
business day will be at 
high risk for wasting vaccine and the need to re
-
vaccinate patien
ts. Facilities failing to report a 
temperature excursion and facilities with
 
repeated temperature excursions will be closely monitored and 
required to submit weekly data logger reports to the program. Facilities identified as having these issues 
will be re
viewed on a case
-
by

case basis and will risk having their vaccines reallocat
ed to other facilities if 
these issues are not corrected or if it is determined that the facility is negligent in 
its 
handling of vaccines.

Section 9: COVID
-
19 Vaccine Administra
tion Documentation and 
Reporting
 

 
Illinois will use I
-
CARE,
 
the 
s

ization Information System (IIS),
 
to collect 
information about 
COVID
-
19 vaccine doses administered by providers. The immunization 
program manages the IIS and supports its users. CO
VID
-
19 vaccine information will be 
collected through the IIS and sent to 
the
 
CDC via the IZ Gateway.
 
Ensuring that each COVID
-
19 vaccination provider is ready and able to report required COVID
-
19 vaccine administration 
data elements to IIS is part of the C
OVID

is 
posited
 
on
 
the

Vaccine Administration Reporting
 

 
Prior versions of 
the
 
State of Illinois COVID
-
19 Vaccination Plan
 
referenced
 
daily 
vaccine 
accountability reports to IDPH
. 
However, t
he federal system,
 
Tiberi
us,
 
gives continuous
 
live 
views
 
of vaccine 
status 
across the state
, thus removing this requirement
. 
Data in Tiberius
 
is 
generated based on allocations to the state f
ro
m the CDC and daily inventory reported by 
COVID
-
19 Vaccine Providers in the VaccineFinder system. 
These numbe
rs 
are 
assessed 
when 
making 
vaccine 
allocations
, which happens weekly. 
 

 
IDPH is required to subm
it 
daily 
inventory reports to CDC. 
Daily 
reports must be submitted to 
CDC by 4:00 
p.m. 
CST. 
R
eporting frequency and required data metrics will be updated as mor
e 
guidance is received from 
the 
CDC.
 
 

 
IDPH will
 
evaluate timeliness and completeness of reportin
g
 
in VaccineFinder and I
-
CARE
 
of 
COVID
-
19 vaccine administration at the organization and facility level. These teams will reach 
out to COVID
-
19 providers who ar
e not reporting every 24 hours and help with 
troubleshooting barriers to successful reporting.
 
A
ll 
providers
 
must abide by CDC program
 
requirements
 
to be authorized to receive vaccine.
 

 
IDPH will regularly 
use data provided in I
-
CARE 
and VaccineFinder 
to identify
 
how many 
vaccines have been administered
, 
how much vaccine is on hand, 
and
 
vaccination 
ad
ministration versus documentation entry timestamps. This will provide insight into 
accurate and complete 
stat
us of vaccine operations in the state.
 
Vaccine Administration Tracking
 

 
At the provider level, two
 
systems will be available in Illinois for patient
 
vaccine administration 
tracking: 
 
o
 
I
-
CARE
: 
For overall patient tracking in Illinois
, 
I
-
CARE 
is
 
us
ed
 
to track 
individual patient 
information and conduct 
and/or recall notification 
for additional doses.
 
o
 
EMTrack
: 
EMTrack 
is
 
utilized 
in Illinois by EMS systems
 
for patient tracking. The EMTrack 
Mass Testing and Vaccination Module was 
utilized
 
for vaccination clinics
/P
ODs
 
during 
the 
H1N1 
pandemic 
and is 
utilized 
at seasonal flu clinics. The 
module 
enables clients to 
schedule appointment
s
 
and be pre
-
screened for v
accination prior to 
going to
 
a
 
vaccination site.
 
EMTrack
 
was upgraded for the COVID
-
19 pandemic
 
and 
is an optional 
system 
for all COVID
-
19 vaccine provider
s in the State of Illinois
,
 
at no cost
.
 
 49
 

 
All providers must plan to 
us
e I
-
CARE or EMTrack for vaccine
 
administration tracking and 
reminders to recipients of a
 
second dose if needed.
 
Providers may 
us
e their Electronic Medical 
Record (EMR) systems if they have their systems connected 
and reporting to 
I
-
CARE.
 

 
Vaccine administration tracking is essential to th
e SARS
-
CoV
-
2/COVID
-
19 vaccine campaign 
for several reaso
ns. 
E
ach person may need to receive two doses of the same vaccine 
separated by 21 or 28 days
,
 
and 
the vaccine administration record will 
assist
 
provider
s
 
for the 
second dose
 
with 
identifying the corre
ct vaccine for the patient
. 
Additionally, 
to ensure
 
repo
rting of adverse events to the vaccine
, 
administration data need
s
 
to be 
tracked
. 
Finally, 
this provides a
ssurance that all priority groups have adequate access to the vaccine and that 
enough of the po
pulation
 
can be vaccinated in a timely fashion.
 
 

 
One of the needed outputs from the IIS is to d
etermine gaps in vaccine administration across 
geographic or demog
raphic populations
 
to inform 
focused
 
outreach efforts.

s
 
should plan to
 
collaborate with their 
local partners, such as
 
hospitals, long

term care and/or 
assisted living facilities, 
emergency 
management 
and other potential vaccine providers that serve 
priority groups 
in their jurisdiction
,
 
to ensure 
access to
 
vaccine to the des
ignated priority groups 
and 
eventually
 
to the g
eneral public. 
LHDs should work with these local partners to ensure they 
are reaching 
the 
hardest hit communities within the identified priority groups.
 
 50
 

 
LHDs should reach out to these groups to determine 
the 
n
umber, type, and location of each 
priority grou
p in the public health jurisdiction.
 

 
While vaccine supply is limited
, LHDs should 
ensure
 
that individuals in earlier priority groups have 
an opportunity to be vaccinated 
prior to using vaccine for closed PODs 
for lower risk groups.
 
 
Utilizing systems like 
EMTrack, p
ersons in the priority groups 
of the given phase 
can
 
register
 
online 
for an 
appointment
 
for vaccinations at their desired POD location. Once a person is registered, they are 
provided 
a

(
or provided 
a 
receipt that can be printed
)
 
that can be 
used to check in 
on arrival to 
the
 
POD
. Once checked 
in, the person will then be screened. After screening, 
the person will be vaccinated and 
per 
CDC
 
guidance
,
 
will 
be observed for 15 
minutes or
 
for
 
30 min
utes

dose 
Reminders
 
A
ll providers
 
should utilize 
their entire
 
first dose 
allocation from the state 
vaccine distribution
 
program
 
completely
 
without 
the 
concern of preserving 
a
 
second dose
. The go
al for IDPH is to limit waste and 
give 
access to vaccine to as 
many people as possible. If a provider is done with the current phase of the 
Vaccination 
Program
 
within their jurisdiction to the appropriate priority group
 
and vaccine will be 
wasted/expire,
 
t
hey 
should
 
use the remaining allocation for the 
next priority g
roup in the next phase
, in 
order not to waste vaccine
. 
 
For an adequate immune response
, 
dependent on the specifications
 
from the CDC and the manufacturer
, 
individuals may be required to take t
wo doses of the COVID
-
19 vaccine 
administered approximately 
21 
to 
28 days apart
. 
Per the
 
clinical considerations from 
CDC
, 

persons should not be scheduled
 
t
o receive the 
second dose earlier than recommended (i.e., 
3 wee
ks
 
[
Pfizer
]
 
or 
1 month [
Moderna
]
). However,
 
second 
doses administered within a grace period of 4 
days earlier than the recommended date for the second 
dose are still considered valid. D
oses ina
dvertently administered earlier than the grace period should no
t 
be repeated
.

clinical considerations from CDC
 
further states,
 

he second dose should b
e 
administered as close to the recommended interval as 
possible. However, if it i
s not feasible to adhere to 
the recommended interv
al

he second dose of 
the 
Pfizer and 
Moderna COVID

up
 
to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose
. 
There 
is
 
cu
rrently 
limited data on efficacy of 
mRNA
 
COVID

19 vaccines administered beyond this window
. If the

s no need to restart the series.

 
If two doses 
are required, it will be necessary to ensure that 
t
he 
vaccinated person return for the second dose. 
LHD
s 
will arrange for information about the need for a
 
second dose to be provided to recipients at the time o
f
 
initial vaccination
, 
and 
IDPH will provide technical assistance as needed to the LHDs.
 
Per CDC guidance, 
t

in the Tiberius system
.
 
As of June 2, 2021, 
COVID
-
19 vaccines 
may be coadministered with
 
other vaccines 
without regard to 
timing. 
This includes 
simultaneous administration of COVID
-
19 vaccine and other vaccines on the 
same 
day, as we
ll as coadministration
 
within 14 days. 
Per the CDC,
 
i
t is unknown whether reactogenicity of 
COVID
-
19 vaccine 
is increased with coadministration, including with other vaccines known to be more 
reactogenic, such as a
djuvanted vaccines or live vaccines. When 
deciding whether to co
administer 
vaccine(s) 
with 
a 
COVID
-
19 vaccine, providers should consider whether the patient is behind 
or at risk of 
becoming behind on recommended vaccines, their risk of vaccine
-
preventable disease (e.g., during an 
outbreak 
or occup
ational exposures), an
d the reactogenicity profile of the vaccines.
 
 
Providers will make sure 
that 
each person receive
s
 
documentation
 
of vaccination
 
at the time of 
administration
 
that includes 
the 
vaccine 
manufacturer name, lot number, dose, site, and date
 
of 
vaccination for th
e patient's records and the date when the second dose is due
, if a second dose is needed
. 
This documentation may be a COVID
-
19 vaccination record card provided as part of vaccine ancillary kits 
by CDC, a vaccination record card provid
ed by IDPH, or a print

record
 
cards 
with
 
vaccine shipments
. 
P
roviders will be required to provide vaccination cards to those receiving their COVID
-
19 vaccination.
 
The 
card will include the vaccine manufacturer name, vaccine lot number
, date of vaccination, and the date 
to re
turn for y
our second 
dose, if required.
 
If the COVID

19 vaccine 
you receive requires two doses, 
patients should bring their
 
vaccination record card to 
their
 
second

obtain vaccination 
records, 
patients
 
may:
 

 
Vaccination records can be request

that record all immunization doses 
administered by participating providers to persons residing within a given geopolitical area. Immunization 
registries offer a consolidation of patient immunization record
s. Compiling all immunizations in one 
database all
ows easy access for healthcare providers. Certificates for proof of immunization are also 
easier to obtain for the purposes of school and childcare centers. The registry also offers timely reminders 
for vac
cines coming due for patients.
 
I

organizations to ensure those data fields are added to current intake forms and that there are 
processes in place to communicate the importance of completing this 
information with patients during 
the COVID

19 vaccine registration process. 
At this time
,
 
the race and ethnicity data field requirement does 
not apply to records that are uploaded through the HL7 interface option
, but for those records that are 
entered man
ually
. However, HL7 standards specify if th
e EMR or sending system collects race and 
ethnicity
 
data
. Those fields should be sent to I

quality 
patient immunization records, applying vaccine evaluation and forecasting algorithms, and 
transforming this data into actionable information for clinicians, publ
ic health practitioners, 
and other IIS user
s to support immunization practice and improvement in one secured 
system.
 

 
Some functions support overall operations, 
such as 
establishing interoperable connections 
with other systems and deduplication functionalit
y for achieving high data quality. Other 
fu
nctionality supports clinical decision making for an individual patient, assessment of vaccine 
coverage rates for groups of patients or populations, reminder
 
and/or 
recall outreach to 
improve vaccination rates, an
d management of vaccine inventory.
 

 
For acce

The 
Mass Immunization Module is an
 
integral part of and is built into the IIS, eliminating the 
need to build an interface. The Mass Immunization Module allows for faster data entry during 
vaccination events as 
lot number defaults 
are added prior to conducting 
these events. Setting 
the defa
ult lot number(s) results in the lot number being automatically populated in the 
patient's record. When the administered vaccine and lot number are added to the patient 
record, the vaccine dose is subtracted from the inventory
, maintaining vaccine dose 
acc
ountability and accurate inventory management.
 
In the event that I
-
CARE is unavailable, vaccine administration information will be recorded on paper logs 
or in Excel spreadsheets that will be transcribed into the IIS when acce
ss returns. 
P
lanned contingenc

Emergency Use Authorization
 
(EUA)
 
Fact Sheets
 
The EUA authority allows 
the 
FDA to authorize either the use of an unapproved medical product (e.g., 
drug, vaccine, or d
iagn
ostic device) or the unapproved use of an approved medical product during an 
emergency based on certain criteria. The EUA will outline how the COVID
-
19 vaccine should be 
us
ed
 
and 
any conditions that must be met to use the vaccine. FDA will coordinate w
ith 
the 
CDC to confirm these 
conditions of authorization. Vaccine conditions of authorization are expected to include distribution 
requirements, reporting requirements, and safety and monitoring requirements. The EUA will be 
authorized for a specific perio
d (i
.e., for the duration of the COVID
-
19 pandemic
) to meet response needs
. 
Additional information on EUAs, including guidance and frequently asked questions, is located on the 
FDA 
website
.
 
Product
-
specific EUA fact sheet
s
 
for COVID
-
19 vaccination providers will be made available 
by the FDA 
that include information on the specific vaccine product and instructions for 
its use. The FDA will develop 
EUA fact sheets for vaccine recipients. EUA fact sheets will likely be made available on the FDA website 
and through the CDC website. IDPH will use 
multiple communication 
media
s
 
to reach COVID
-
19 vaccine 
providers
,
 
such as ema
il distribution lists, webpages, and SIREN alerts to contact enrolled providers and 
make them aware of the appropriate EUA fact sheets. Furthermore, IDPH will provide training we
binars 
on the EUA fact sheets and the VISs to ensure that providers understand
 
the information and are clear on 
the requirement to provide the recipient fact sheet to each client
 
or 
patient prior to administering vaccine.
 
Vaccine Information Statements (VI
S
s
)
 
VISs are required only if a vaccine is added to the Vaccine Injury Table. 
Optional VISs may be produced 
but only after a vaccine has been licensed (e.g., such as with zoster vaccines). Plans for developing a VIS 
for COVID
-
19 vaccine are not known at th
is time but will be communicated as additional information 
becomes available. 
IDPH will disseminate VISs similarly to 
the way 
EUA fact

security standards and 
protections concerning health information.
 
VAERS reports should go directly to the VAERS si
te. Providers will receive an educational packet upon 
enrollment into the COVID
-
19 Vaccination Program. Guidance documents will include information on 
required reporting of vaccine adverse events to VAERS. IDPH will provide technical assistance and 
communi
cate with the CDC on all aspects of vaccine adverse event reporting. Vaccine safety and 
education will be provided by the CDC and IDPH to providers sta
tewide and the link to the VAERS site will 
be posted on the IDPH COVID

FOREWORD
 
Influenza is an acute viral infection that spreads easily from person
-
to
-
person. It causes 
illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths every year in Illinois. Intermittently over the centuries, 
changes in the genetic
 
makeup of influenza virus have resulted in new strains to which people 
have never been exposed. These new strains have the potential to cause a pandemic or 
worldwide outbreak of influenza, with potentially catastrophic consequences. In Illinois alone, 
a p
andemic of even modest severity could result in thousands of deaths and the sickening of 
millions, even among previously healthy persons.
 
 
In 2009, a new strain of influenza virus, 2009A(H1N1)pdm, emerged. The U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) worked with manufacturers to develop a vaccine; 
however, the time it took to develop a vaccine caused a severe shortage in available vaccine 
during the height of the outbreak. Manufacturers have since developed ample amounts of 
vaccine to 
the 2009A(H1N1)pdm influenza strain; still, new genetic strains can arise leading to 
another pandemic influenza.
 
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
was 
developed:
 

 
To identify steps that need to be taken by state 
government and its partners 
prior to a pandemic to improve the level of preparedness;
 
and
 

 
To coordinate state government
-
wide 
response 
activities in the event a 
pandemic
 
occurs.
 
 
These preparedness and response activities are organized according to the six
 
pandemic 
phases identified by the World Health Organization (WHO).
 
 
This plan was developed through a collaborative process involving Illinois 
Department of Public Health offices and divisions and partner state agencies that have a 
pandemic response role.

NFLUENZA
 
An influenza pandemic can occur 
when a non
-
human (novel) influenza virus gains the ability 
for efficient and sustained human
-
to
-
human transmission and then spreads globally. Pandemics 

caused by subt
ypes of influenza viruses already in existence among people. Past influenza 
pandemics have led to high levels of illness, death, social disruption and economic loss.
 
 

za 

include influenza A, H5N1 and influenza A, H7N9. These are two different types of avian 
(bird) influenza viruses. These non
-
human viruses are novel among humans and 
circulate in 
birds in parts of the world. There is little to no immunity against these viruses among people. 
Human infections with these viruses have occurred rarely. If either virus changes in such a 
way to allow for efficient infections in humans and sus
tained person
-
to
-
person transmission of 
the virus, an influenza pandemic could result.
 
 
Influenza pandemics are different from many of the threats for which public health and the 
health care system are currently planning:
 

 
The pandemic will last much 
longer that most other emergency events and may include 

th
 
century pandemics, a second 
wave of influenza activity occurred 3
-
to 12
-
months after the first
 
wave).
 

 
The number of health care 
workers and first responders available to work is expected to 
be reduced, as many will be at high risk of illness through exposure in the community 
and in health care settings, and others may have to miss work to care for ill family
 
members.
 

 
Resources in m
any locations could be limited due to the impact of the 
widespread nature of influenza
 
pandemic.
 
 
The severity of the next pandemic cannot be predicted, but it is expected that susceptibility to 
the pandemic influenza virus will be universal. Approximately
 
half of those who become ill will 
seek outpatient care. While it depends on the virulence of the virus, a severe pandemic influenza 
could cause an estimated 2 million deaths in the United States.
 
 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan
 
The purpose of the 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
is to provide a 
framework for local, state and federal public health and medical officials to work together to 
reduce morbidity, mortality and social disruption that would result from a p
andemic influenza 
outbreak.
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
3
 
 
 
 
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
was developed through a collaborative 
process involving offices and divisions within the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) 
and state of Illinois part
ner agencies that have a response role during a pandemic.
 
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
applies to all state agencies, 
departments and commissions under the authority of the governor that may be requested to 
provide 
assistance or conduct operations in actual or potential incidents. These incidents require 
a coordinated response by an appropriate combination of federal, state, local and 
nongovernmental entities.
 
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan , 
as with all state emergency response 
plans, operates within the framework of the 
Illinois Emergency Operations Plan
. Moreover, the 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
is intended to work in co
ncert with several 
other plans that will be implemented during a pandemic to guide various aspects of the 
response, including the 
IDPH Emergency Operations Plan
, the 
Illinois Strategic National 
Stockpile Plan 
and the 
Illinois Health and Medical Care Respon
se Plan.
 
 
The overall direction and control authority reside with the Office of the Governor, with 
coordination and management expertise supplied by the Illinois Emergency Management 
Agency (IEMA). IDPH serves as the lead state agency and will assume a cen
tral response role 
throughout a pandemic influenza outbreak. Additionally, IDPH will provide the technical 
expertise and statutory authority over many of the health and medical issues that may arise.
 
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
is
 
to be implemented within the context 
of a unified command emergency operating structure involving representation from local, state 

the outbreak and to rapidly 
mobilize and deploy resources to assist local governments in their 
efforts to mitigate morbidity and mortality and the demand on most essential government 
services.
 
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
provides a set of preparedness activi
ties and 
response functions to be carried out by IDPH and, where appropriate, provide local health 
departments, health care provider systems and first responder organizations with preparedness and 
response expectations.
 
 
These preparedness and response act
ivities are organized according to the six pandemic 
phases identified by the World Health Organization (WHO).
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1

Phase
 
Definition
 
Phase 1
 
No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in
 
humans. However, a circulating animal 
influenza virus 
subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease.
 
 
Phase 2
 
No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. 
An influenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may 
be present in animals. If present in animals, the 
risk of human 
infection or disease is considered to be
 
low.
 
 
Phase 3
 
Human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no human
-
to
-
 
human 
spread, or at most rare instances of spread to a close
 
contact.
 
 
Phase 4
 
Small cluster(s) with limited 
human
-
to
-
human transmission, but 
spread is highly localized, suggesting the virus is not well
 
adapted to humans.
 
 
Phase 5
 
Larger cluster(s), but human
-
to
-
human spread still localized, 
suggesting the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to 
humans, but may not yet be fully transmissible (substantial
 
pandemic risk).
 
Phase 6
 
Pandemic: increased and sustained transmission in general
 
population.
 
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
is organized into three parts: Basic 
Plan, Concept of Operations and Support Annexes.
 
 
The Basic Plan describes the overall 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
organization, establishes the plan
ning assumptions for a pandemic response, and defines the roles 
and responsibilities of local, state and federal agencies.
 
 
The Concept of Operations provides guidance on conducting activities that aid in all entities 
being prepared to respond to and to mi
tigate a pandemic influenza outbreak. The Concept of 
Operations also details the overall direction and control of the response and further outlines the 
roles and responsibilities of all involved agencies.
 
Concept of Operations guidance is broken down into 
what individual agencies should be doing 
prior to the outbreak 
-

outbreak
-
 
recovery. Prep
aredness, as defined by the National Incident Management System 
(NIMS), is a continuous cycle of planning, organizing, training, equipping, exercising, 
evaluation and taking corrective action in an effort to ensure effective coordination during an 
incident
 
response. Preparedness activities associated with the 
plan 
are:
 
 

 
Training

Training will be delivered primarily through presentations and independent study 
courses. The targeted audiences include decision makers and other key elected and appointed 
official
s, first responders, local health department personnel and health care system personnel. 
Some of the more important topics
 
to
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
5
 
 
 
 
be covered: plans and procedures familiarization, media relations, and pandemic influenza 
characteristics and histo
ry.
 
 

 
Exercises

Tabletop exercises must be conducted for various audiences, including those who 

officials from all three branches of government.  Once roles and 
main operational concepts 
have been established and tested via tabletop exercises, functional and/or full
-
scale exercises 

include the efficacy of the process and commu
nication flow within and outside of this
 
structure.
 
 

 
Risk communication

Timely, accurate, consistent and useful information must be 
regularly provided to the public, health care providers, local officials and the news media. 
Misinformation trends must be i
dentified quickly and
 
rectified.
 
 

 
Resource stockpiling and the identification of priority groups for receipt of these 
resources

A vaccine against the pandemic flu most likely will not be available or in 
sufficient quantities within the first six 
months of the outbreak, so national and state stockpiles 
of antiviral medications will be necessary to support response activities. The U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services (USHHS) will establish priority groups for vaccination and for 
antiviral tr
eatment and
 
prophylaxis.
 
 
NIMS defines response as activities that address the short
-
term, direct effects of an incident. 
Response includes immediate actions to save lives, to protect property and to meet basic human 
needs. Response also includes the execu
tion of emergency operations plans and of mitigation 
activities designed to limit the loss of life, personal injury, property damage and other 
unfavorable outcomes. In the context of the 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
, response guidance
 
includes:
 
 

 
Emergency Operations
-
coordination and management

The main thrust is to keep state 
partners in the response effort informed through briefings, conference calls, and other 
updating and shared decision making mechanisms. The frequency and extent of
 
these 
communications will increase as the pandemic phases
 
escalate.
 
 

 
Epidemiological surveillance and laboratory testing
--
Laboratory testing and disease 
reporting requirements will be expanded and adapted as needed to monitor circulating strains, 
define t
he magnitude and severity of pandemic activity in Illinois, and help target prevention 
and control
 
activities.
 
 

 
Medical countermeasures dispensing and distribution
-
vaccines
--
Increasing adherence to 
recommendations for seasonal influenza 
vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination may 
lessen the adverse effects of an influenza pandemic. Once vaccine becomes available, major 
activities will consist of distributing vaccine to public and/or private sector vaccinators, 
appropriate storage, handli
ng and vaccination, dose tracking, safety monitoring and also using, 
to the extent possible, available federal
 
assets.

Medical countermeasures dispensing and distribution
-
 
antivirals
--
This is primarily a 
logistical operation. Security may be
come an issue and needs to be available. Coordination 
will be needed with neighboring jurisdictions. Inconsistent distribution policies could lead to 
certain jurisdictions being overwhelmed if the public perceives their policies to be relatively 
advantageo
us. Inventories, delivery schedules and usage must be
 
tracked.
 
 

 
Public Information and warning
-
risk communications
--
A sufficient quantity of 
spokespersons should receive media training, instruction in crisis and risk communications, 
and guidance on public 
health measures and messages 
prior 
to the onset of a pandemic. 
Technology, including Internet websites, faxes, electronic mass mailing systems, satellite 
uplinks and telephone hotlines will play key roles in keeping the public and the health care 
community
 
informed. Those providing information to the public must coordinate pandemic 
influenza media messages to ensure consistency and build public confidence in the measures 
being recommended.
 
 

 
Emergency Operations
-
Plans and procedures
--
 
Plans and procedures must be adjusted to 
reflect emergency legislation or administrative rule changes. In addition, response partners 
must review and modify plans and procedures to reflect changing conditions and
 
needs.
 
 

 
Community Preparedness
-
School Closures
--
IDPH will provide the Illinois
 
State 
Board of Education with updates on influenza activity and recommendations regarding 
school
 
closures.
 
 
Recovery is primarily an IEMA role that involves coordinating assist
ance to organizations that 
help individuals, communities and commercial enterprises return to pre
-
pandemic conditions as 
quickly as possible. State and federal statutes govern many aspects of the recovery phase.
 
 
The Support Annexes establish and 
describe major operational functions, which will serve as 
the building blocks of an emergency response effort throughout the stages of an influenza 
pandemic. Certain characteristics of the eight pandemic influenza response functions are 
displayed in the ta
ble on the following page.
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
should be read and
 
understood prior to 
an influenza pandemic. It is a dynamic document that will be updated to reflect new 
developments in the understanding of the influenza vi
rus, its spread, treatment and prevention.  
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
also will incorporate changes in 
response roles and improvements in response capability development through ongoing planning
 
efforts.

Introduction
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan

Version 5.1

Pandemic: A Worldwide Outbreak of Influenza
 
An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of disease that 
occurs when a new influenza A 

easily from person
-
to
-
person worldwide. Pandemics are different from seasonal outbreaks or 

ks are caused by subtypes of influenza viruses 
already in existence among people, whereas pandemic outbreaks are caused by new subtypes 
or by subtypes that have never circulated among people or that have not circulated among 
people for a long time. Past in
fluenza pandemics have led to high levels of illness, death, 
social disruption and economic loss.
 
 
Phases of a Pandemic
 
 
Phase
 
Definition
 
 
Phase 1
 
No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in 
humans. However, a circulating animal 
influenza virus 
subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease.
 
 
 
Phase 2
 
No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. 
An influenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may 
be present in animals. If present in animals, the 
risk of human 
infection or disease is considered to be low.
 
 
Phase 3
 
Human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no human
-
to
-
 
human 
spread, or at most rare instances of spread to a close contact.
 
 
Phase 4
 
Small cluster(s) with limited 
human
-
to
-
human transmission, but 
spread is highly localized, suggesting the virus is not well adapted 
to humans.
 
 
Phase 5
 
Larger cluster(s) but human
-
to
-
human spread still localized, 
suggesting the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to 
humans, 
but may not yet be fully transmissible (substantial 
pandemic risk).
 
 
Phase 6
 
Pandemic: increased and sustained transmission in general 
population.
 
 
Vaccines to Protect Against Pandemic Influenza Viruses
 
 
A vaccine may not be available in the early 
stages of a pandemic. When a new vaccine against an 
influenza virus is being developed, scientists around the world work together to select the virus 
strain that will offer the best protection against that
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
10
 
 
 
 
virus, and then 
manufacturers use the selected strain to develop a vaccine. Once a potential 
pandemic strain of influenza virus is identified, it takes 6
-
to
-
8
-
months before a vaccine will be 
widely available. If a pandemic occurs, it is expected that the U.S. government w
ill work with 
many partner groups to make recommendations to guide the early use of
 
vaccine.
 
 
Antiviral Medications to Prevent and Treat Pandemic Influenza
 
 
Four different influenza antiviral medications (amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir and 
zanamivir)
 
are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment and/or 
prevention of influenza. All four work against influenza A viruses. However, sometimes 
influenza virus strains can become resistant to one or more of these drugs, and thus the 
drugs 
may not always work. The CDC recommendations will be implemented to ensure medications 
provided will adequately treat the circulating influenza strain.
 
 
Preparing for the Next Pandemic
 
 
Many scientists believe it is only a matter of time until the ne
xt influenza pandemic occurs. The 
severity of the next pandemic cannot be predicted, but modeling studies suggest its effect in the 
United States could be severe. In the absence of any control measures (vaccination or drugs), it 
has been estimated that in 



207,000 deaths, between 314,000 and 734,000 hospitalizations, 18 million to 42 million 
outpatient visits, and another 20 million to 47 million people being sick. Between 15 percent and 
35 pe
rcent of the U.S. population could be affected by influenza pandemic, and the economic 
impact could range between $71.3 billion and $166.5
 
billion.

*Estimates are based on CDC national projections
 
 
Influenza pandemics are 
different from many of the threats for which public health and the 
health care system are currently planning:
 
 

 
The pandemic will last much longer than most other emergency events and may include 

ntury pandemics, a second 
wave of influenza activity occurred 3
-
 
to 12
-
months after the first
 
wave).
 

 
The numbers of health care workers and first responders available to work can be 
expected to be reduced; they will be at high risk of illness through
 
expos
ure
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan

in the community and in health care settings, and some may have to miss work to care 
for ill family members.
 

 
Resources in many locations could be limited because of how widespread
 
the 
influenza pandemic would
 
be.
 
 
Because of these differences and the expected size of an influenza pandemic, it is important to 
have completed planning and preparedness activities to be able to respond promptly and 
adequately. The purpose of the 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness a
nd Response Plan 
is 
to provide a framework for federal, state and local public health and medical officials to work 
together to reduce the influenza morbidity, mortality and social disruption that would result from 
a pandemic influenza
 
outbreak.
 
 
The 
Illin
ois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
should be read and
 
understood prior to 
an influenza pandemic. It is a dynamic document that will be updated to reflect new 
developments in the understanding of the influenza virus, its spread, treatment and preve
ntion.  
The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
also will incorporate changes in 
response roles and improvements in response capability development through ongoing planning
 
efforts.

Purpose
 
The purpose of the 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
is to provide a 
framework for federal, state, local, private sector and nongovernmental entities to work together 
to reduce the influenza morbi
dity, mortality, and social disruption that would result from a 
pandemic influenza outbreak. The 
Illinois Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan 
describes the incident management activities, concepts and structure under which Illinois will 
operate during 
a pandemic influenza outbreak and the roles and responsibilities and activities 
that apply to command and control staff. Other goals and objectives of the 
Illinois Pandemic 
Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
include:
 

 
Define and recommend preparedness
 
activities that should be undertaken before a 
pandemic that will enhance the effectiveness of a pandemic
 
response.
 

 
Describe state coordination of a pandemic response and collaboration with local 
levels, including definition of roles, responsibilities and
 
actions.
 

 
Describe interventions that should be implemented as components of an effective

3.0
 
Plan
 
Organization
 
The 
Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
includes an Introduction, Basic Plan, 
Concept of Operations, Support Annexes and Appendices. The core plan describes coordination 
and decision making at the state level; provides a
n overview of key issues for preparedness and 
response; and outlines action steps to be taken at the state level before, during and after a 
pandemic.
 
 
The Support Annexes describe activities of the primary and support elements needed for 
effective response. The annexes provide guidance for Illinois government agencies and 
departments to conduct emergency preparedness, response and recovery. The 
Illinois 
Strategic 
National Stockpile Plan 
and 
Health and Medical Care Response Plan 
are supplements to the 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
that relate to functions specific to 
requesting, to receiving, to distributing and to dispensing v
accine, antivirals and other medical 
material; and medical surge and mass care.  The supplemental plans work in conjunction with the 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response
 
Plan
.
 
 
The Appendices provide clarification or additional information
 
to support the Basic Plan, 
Concept of Operations and Support Annexes.
 
4.0
 
Applicability
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
applies to all state agencies, 
departments and commissions under the governor that may be requested to p
rovide assistance or 
conduct operations in actual or potential incidents. These incidents require a coordinated 
response by an appropriate combination of federal, state, local and nongovernmental entities.
 
 
5.0
 
Incident Management
 
Activities
 
The 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
addresses the full spectrum 
of activities related to incident management, including prevention, preparedness, response and 
recovery actions. This plan focuses on those activities directly related t
o an evolving incident or 
potential incident rather than steady
-
state preparedness or readiness activities conducted in the 
absence of a specific threat or hazard.
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
15
 
 
 
 
When not specifically prescribed, a Unified Command consisting of local, stat
e and federal 
senior competent emergency response officials at the site shall be the preferred approach to 
integrating several levels of government into an Incident Command System (ICS) during 
pandemic influenza.
 
 
6.0
 
Policies
 
Capabilities
 
 
Illinois will e
stablish and maintain an effective preparedness, response and recovery capability 
for any level of emergency requiring state assistance. The Illinois Emergency Management 
Agency (IEMA) is the governor's staff agency responsible for management and coordinat
ion 
of the state's disaster response and recovery efforts. Each state agency will maintain its own 
internal control structure and organization during disasters.
 
 
Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC)
 
 
Illinois is a member of the Emergency 
Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), a 
collaborative network among member states that expedites the delivery of resources in disasters. 
After a governor declares an emergency, the state emergency management agency assesses the 
disaster
-
related needs, the 
state requests resources through EMAC and other states provide 

EMAC requests. Requests made through the Federal Emergency Management Agency mission 
assignment process
 
also will be addressed in conjunction with EMAC requests.
 
 
7.0
 
Key
 
Concepts
 
This section summarizes key concepts that are reflected throughout the 
Illinois Pandemic 
Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan
.
 
 

 
Systematic and coordinated incident 
management, including protocols for incident 
reporting; coordinated action, alert and notification, mobilization of state resources to 
augment existing local capabilities, operations under differing threats or threat levels, 
and integration of crisis and c
onsequence management
 
functions.
 

 
Notification and deployment of state resources in anticipation of or in response to 
catastrophic events in coordination and collaboration with local governments and private 
entities, when
 
possible.
 

 
Coordination of incident 
communication, worker safety and health, private
-
 
sector 
involvement and other activities that are common to the majority of incidents.
 

 
Organization of Support Annexes to facilitate the delivery of critical state resources, 
assets and assistance. State dep
artments and agencies agree
 
to
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
16
 
 
 
 
assist with activities listed in the Support Annexes based on authorities, 
resources and capabilities.
 

 
Provision of mechanisms for vertical and horizontal coordination, communications 
and information 
sharing in response to threats or incidents. These mechanisms 
facilitate coordination among state and local entities and the federal government, as 
well as between the public and private
 
sectors.
 

 
Facilitation of state support to departments and agencies ac
ting under the requesting 

 
authorities.
 

 
Provision of the basis for coordination of interagency and intergovernmental 
planning, training, exercising, assessment, coordination and information exchange.
 
 
8.0
 
Planning 
Assumptions and
 
Considerations
 
Command and Control
 
 

 
Incidents are typically managed at the lowest possible geographic, 
organizational and jurisdictional
 
level.
 

 
Incident management activities will be initiated and conducted using the principles 
contained in the National Information Management System
 
(NIMS).
 

 
The combined expertise and capabilities of government at all levels, the private sector 
and nongovernmental organizations will be required to prevent, to prepare for, to 
respond to and to reco
ver from the
 
incident.
 

 
Local governments have the primary responsibility to provide public health and 
emergency medical services within their
 
jurisdictions.
 

 
State government will provide (for counties without a health department) and/or augment 
public heal
th and emergency medical services that exceed the capabilities of the local
 
government.
 
 
Federal Government
 
 

 
The federal government has assumed primary responsibility for a number of key elements 
of the national plan,
 
including:
 
o
 
Vaccine research and
 
development.
 
o
 
Coordination of national and international
 
surveillance.
 
o
 
Assessment and potential enhancement of the coordination of vaccine and 
antiviral capacity and coordination of public
-
sector
 
procurement.
 
o
 
Assessment of the need for and scope of a 
suitable liability program
 
for vaccine 
manufacturers and persons administering the
 
vaccine.
 
o
 

information, vaccine distribution and
 
redistribution.
 
 
State and Local Governments and 
Health Care System
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
17
 
 
 
 

 
Influenza pandemic will place a substantial burden on inpatient and outpatient health 
care services. Because of the increased risk of exposure to pandemic virus in health care 
settings, illness and absenteeism among health
 
care workers in the context of increased 
demand will further strain the ability to provide quality
 
care.
 

 
In addition to a limited number of hospital beds and staff shortages, equipment and 
supplies may be in short supply. The disruptions in the health car
e system that result 
from a pandemic also may have an impact on blood donation and supply.
 

 
Planning by state and local health departments and the health care system is important to 
address potential shortages. Strategies to increase hospital bed availabili
ty include 
deferring elective procedures, more stringent triage for admission and earlier discharge 
with follow
-
up by home health care personnel. Local coordination can help direct 
patients to hospitals with available beds
 
and distribute resources to sites
 
where they are
 
needed.
 

 
Health care facilities may need to be established in nontraditional sites to help address 
temporary surge needs. Specific challenges in these settings such as infection control, 
staffing and command and control, must be
 
addressed.
 

 
Not all ill persons will require hospital care but many may need other support services. 
These include home health care, delivery of prescription drugs, and meals. Local 
planning is needed to address the delivery of these and essential community
 
functions 
such as police, fire and utility service, including drinking water, waste water and power
 
services.
 

 
The Medical Surge Capacity and Capability (MSCC) handbook (September 2007) 
includes the planning concepts and doctrine that describe 
response activities related to 
meeting increased medical demands, and how responders integrate across the system 
from the local to federal levels. MSCC planning themes should be employed in order to 
fully address anticipated problems, especially at the com
munity level where individual 

 
systems.
 
 
Vaccine and Antiviral Supply Levels and Availability
 
 

 
When a pandemic first strikes, vaccine will likely not be ready for distribution. Because 
of this, other
 
measures may include antiviral drug therapy (treatment) and preventive use 
in those not infected (prophylaxis) as directed by a health care provider, quality medical 
care and interventions to decrease exposure and/or transmission of infection.  These 
meas
ures will be important approaches to decrease the disease burden and potentially 
reduce the spread of the pandemic until vaccine becomes
 
available.
 
 

 
Vaccine will need to be targeted to priority groups that will be defined based on several 
factors. These ma
y include: the impact of the circulating pandemic virus on various age 
groups; and heightened risks for persons with specific conditions; the risk of 
occupational infections/transmission (e.g., health
 
care
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
18
 
 
 
 
workers); and the 
responsibilities of certain occupations in providing essential public 
health safety services to include, but not limited to police, fire, power, natural gas, 
drinking water and waste water. Although the priority groups for annual influenza 
vaccination will
 
provide some guidance for vaccine for a pandemic, the risk profile for a 
pandemic strain and the priorities for vaccination may differ substantially and therefore 
will need to be guided by the epidemiologic pattern of the pandemic as it unfolds.
 

 
Later in 
the pandemic, vaccine supply will approximate demand, and 
vaccination of the full at
-
risk population can
 
occur.
 

 
The objective of antiviral prophylaxis is to prevent influenza illness. Prophylaxis 
would need to continue throughout the period of exposure in 
a community. The 
objective of treatment is to decrease the consequences of infection. For optimal 
impact, treatment needs to be started as soon as possible and within 48 hours of the 
onset of
 
illness.
 

 
The available supply of influenza antiviral 
medications is limited and production cannot 
be rapidly expanded. There are few manufacturers and these drugs have a long 
production process. In 2003, oseltamivir was added to the SNS. Analysis is ongoing to 
define optimal antiviral use strategies, potenti
al health impacts and cost
-
effectiveness of 
antiviral drugs in the setting of a pandemic. Results of these analyses will contribute to 
decisions regarding the appropriate antiviral drugs to maintain in the SNS. Planning by 
public and private health care or
ganizations is needed to assure effective use of available 
drugs, whether from a national stockpile, state stockpile or the private
 
sector.
 

 
Developing guidelines and educating physicians, nurses and other health
 
care workers 
before and during the pandemic 
will be important to promote effective use of these 
agents in the private
 
sector.
 
 
Infection Control and Disease Containment
 

 
Infection control in hospitals and long
-
term care facilities mitigates the
 
spread of 
infection among high
-
risk populations and heal
th care
 
workers.
 

 
Influenza strains that cause annual outbreaks are effectively transmitted between people 
and can be transmitted by people who are infected but appear well. Efforts to prevent 
their introduction into the United States or decrease transmissi
on in the community are 
likely to have limited
 
effectiveness.
 

 
If a novel influenza strain that is not as efficiently spread between people causes 
outbreaks in other countries or the United States, measures such as screening 
travelers from affected 
areas, limiting public gatherings, closing schools and/or 
quarantining of exposed persons could slow the spread of disease. Decisions 
regarding use of these measures will need to be based on their effectiveness and the 
epidemiology of the
 
pandemic.
 
 
Emergency and Risk Communication
 

 
Inform health care providers and the public about influenza disease and the course of 
the pandemic, the ability to treat mild illness at home,

Local Health Departments and Health Care Providers
 
Local and 
municipal health departments are responsible for communitywide influenza 
preparedness activities. Specific activities of the local and municipal health department staff 
include:
 

 
Promote vaccinations to prevent
 
diseases.
 

 
Distribute vaccine to public and pri
vate providers,
 
communitywide.
 

 
Survey and control outbreak of preventable adult and childhood
 
diseases.

Approximately 66 sentinel physicians around Illinois report each week (October
-
May; some 
year round) the total number of patients seen and the number of those patients with 
influenza
-
like illness by age group. Through its surveillance systems, CDC develops a national picture of 
influenza virus activity, the geographic distribution of influenza viruses and the impact of 
influenza on different age groups.
 
 
The Regional Hospital
 
Coordinating Center (RHCC), formerly known as the POD hospital, is 
the lead hospital in a specific region responsible for coordinating disaster medical response 
upon the activation of the 
Health and Medical Care Response Plan 
by the Department. The 
RHCC s
erves as the primary point of contact for communication and coordination of disaster 
response activities with its resource, associate and participating hospital(s), and EMS 
provider(s).
 
 
Nongovernmental and Volunteer Organizations (NGO)
 
 
NGOs collaborate w
ith first responders, state and local government officials, and other agencies 
and organizations providing relief services to sustain life, reduce physical and emotional 
distress, and promote recovery of disaster victims when assistance is not available fr
om other 
sources. In Illinois, the American Red Cross as a member of the 
State Emergency Operations 
Center (SEOC)
 
is the coordinating NGO that provides disaster preparedness and relief at the 
local level and also coordinates the mass care element of the IE
OP. Community
-
based 
organizations (CBOs) receive government funding to provide essential public health services. 
Their response elements will be coordinated by the American Red Cross, in accordance with the
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1

American Red Cross 
agreements with such organizations. NGOs will be identified and assigned 
response functions to support this plan by state and local officials per the IEOP, as well as 
direction and coordination from the American Red Cross, in accordance with the American R
ed 
Cross agreements with such organizations.
 
 
Private Sector
 
 
The roles, responsibilities and participation of the private sector during a pandemic influenza 
outbreak vary based on the nature of the organization and the type and impact of the incident. In 

Task Force, has been formed to coordinate the emergency preparedness, response and recovery 
activities of private and public agencies. Private
-
sector organiz
ations support this plan by 
sharing information with the government, identifying risks, performing vulnerability 
assessments, developing emergency response and business continuity plans, enhancing their 
overall readiness, implementing appropriate preventio
n and protection programs, and donating 
or otherwise providing goods and services through contractual arrangement or government 
purchases to assist in response to and recovery from an incident.
 
 
Certified local health departments and certified local emerge
ncy management agencies are 
strongly encouraged to reach out to their local private sector partners to identify the critical 
personnel from each private sector entity in the local health department and/or local emergency 
management agency jurisdiction. The
 
goal is to ensure private sector critical personnel necessary 
for the maintenance of jurisdictional critical infrastructure are provided medical prophylaxis, if 
indicated or required, during a pandemic flu outbreak.
 
 
Citizen Involvement
 
Strong partnership
s with citizen groups and organizations provide support for incident 
management prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation.
 
 
The U.S. Citizen Corps brings these groups together and focuses efforts of individuals through 
education, training
 
and volunteer service to help make communities safer, stronger and better 
prepared to address the threats of terrorism, crime, public health issues and disasters of all kinds.
 
 
Local citizen corps councils implement citizen corps programs, which include C
ommunity 
Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), Neighborhood 
Watch, Volunteers in Police Service and the affiliate programs; to provide opportunities for 
special skills and interests; develop targeted outreach for special
-
needs grou
ps; and organize 
special projects and community events.
 
 
Citizen corps affiliate programs expand the resources and materials available to state and local 
communities through partnerships with programs and organizations that offer resources for 
public educa
tion, outreach and training; represent volunteers interested in helping to make their 
communities safer; or offer volunteer service
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan

opportunities to support first responders, disaster relief activities and community safety 
efforts.
 
 
Illinois has 
over 70
 
MRC units, most of which are housed by local health departments. These 
units serve primarily health missions, such as mass vaccination or prophylaxis clinics, providing 
health education or staffing call centers. Some, however, work with the medical commun
ity to 
assist in addressing hospital
-
centric surge demands that would surface during a pandemic.
 
 
There are more than 100 CERT programs in Illinois, and these teams are comprised of 
laypersons that have received emergency management training and assist in 
disaster and 
homeland security operations. These teams should be tapped to assist with pandemic influenza 
operations at the local level where possible.
 
 
Other programs unaffiliated with citizen corps also provide organized citizen involvement 
opportunities
 
in support of federal response to major disasters and events of national 
significance. One example is the National Animal Health Emergency Response Corps 
(NAHERC), which helps protect public health by providing a ready reserve of private and state 
animal 
health technicians and veterinarians to combat threats to U.S. livestock and poultry in the 
event of a large outbreak of a foreign animal
 
disease.
 
 
10.0 Plan Development and
 
Maintenance
 
The entire 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
will be reviewed and 
revised annually by the IDPH Office of Preparedness and Response, which will consult with 
other IDPH offices, divisions and programs to ensure continued applicability of assignments and 
other information contained in the plan.
 
 
IDPH st
aff will meet as needed with the agencies and organizations listed in the 
Illinois 
Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan

Concept of
 
Operations
 
General
 
At a local government's request and during the period immediately following the onset of any 
large
-
scale emergency, state agencies may mobilize and deploy resources to the affected area to 
assist local governments.
 
 
A Unified Area 
Command (UAC) may be established for any level of emergency requiring a 
state field presence. However, the location, activities and scope will vary according to the 
parameters of the occurrence. The organizational structure of the UAC will remain basically
 
the 
same for any emergency. The agencies activated for the UAC will be based on the nature and 
magnitude of the situation. The IEOP utilizes the Illinois Disaster Management System (IDMS) 
and the NIMS in all levels of response and recovery.
 
 
The affected 
local government(s) is responsible for identifying and communicating response 
priorities and state resource requirements to the 
SEOC
, through the UAC if activated.
 
 
Public Health and Medical
 
When the state public health director determines morbidity and mo
rtality from a certain disease 
warrant study, he may declare such disease to be the subject of a medical study and issue a 
declaration requiring hospitals, physicians and others to submit such information, data and 
reports as necessary for the purpose of t
he specific study. Such data so obtained will be held 
confidential in accordance with Section 8
-
 
2101 of the Code of Civil Procedure (77 Ill. Adm. 
Code 690.200(f)).
 
 
The Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil Administrative Code of 
Illinois (20 ILCS 2305) provides IDPH with the authority for the general supervision of the 
interests of the health and lives of the people of the state. IDPH is statutorily authorized to 
investigate the causes of dangerously contagious or infectious disea
ses, especially when existing 
in epidemic form, and to take measures to restrict and to suppress the same whenever such 
disease becomes or threatens to become epidemic. This authorization is allowed when a local 
health authority neglects, refuses, or is un
able to perform these duties. Moreover, IDPH is able to 
issue orders for the administration of vaccines, medications or other treatments to persons as 
necessary to prevent the probable spread of a dangerously contagious or infectious disease.
 
 
Additionally
, IDPH, local boards of health and public health authorities have the authority, in 
order to prevent the spread of a dangerously contagious or infectious disease, to access 
medical records, health information or records of cases, provided that confidential
ity 
requirements are met.
 
 
IDPH has absolute authority in matters of quarantine and isolation, and may declare and enforce 
quarantine when none exists, and may modify or relax quarantine when it
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
33
 
 
 
 
has been established. In addition, local board
s of health, health authorities and officers, police 
officers, sheriffs and other officers and employees of the state or any locality have the authority 
to enforce orders issued under Section 2 of the Department of Public Health Act and also shall 
enforce 
the rules and regulations so adopted.
 
 
IDPH shall investigate the causes of dangerously contagious or infectious diseases, especially 
when existing in epidemic form, and take means to restrict and suppress the same. Whenever 
such disease becomes, or 
threatens to become epidemic in any locality, and the local board of 
health or local authorities neglect or refuse to enforce efficient measures for its restriction or 
suppression or to act with sufficient promptness or efficiency,  or  whenever  the local
 
board of 
health or local authorities neglect or refuse to promptly enforce efficient measures for the 
restriction or suppression  of dangerously  contagious or infectious diseases, IDPH may enforce 
such measures as it deems necessary  to  protect  the pub
lic  health, and all necessary expenses 
so incurred shall be paid by the locality for which services are
 
rendered.
 
 
Authority for Direction of Control
 
The overall authority for direction and control within Illinois of the response to a pandemic 
influenza o
utbreak rests with the governor. Article V, Section 6 of the Illinois Constitution of 
1970 and the Governor Succession Act (15 ILCS 5/1) identify the officers next in line of 
succession in the following order: the lieutenant governor, the elected attorney 
general, the 
elected secretary of state, the elected comptroller, the elected treasurer, the president of the 
Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives. The governor is assisted in the exercise 
of direction and control activities by the staff 
of the Office of the Governor and the coordination 
of response activities by IEMA.  The 
State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC)
 
is the strategic 

 
incident.
 
 
The overall 
authority for direction and control for the resources of IDPH that respond to a 
pandemic influenza outbreak is the state public health director. The line of succession for the 
state public health director is the assistant director, followed by the chief of
 
staff. The director is 
assisted in the coordination of pandemic influenza response activities by the deputy director, 
Office of Health Protection; chief, Division of Infectious Diseases; deputy director, Office of 
Preparedness and Response; and other desi
gnated staff.
 
 
Statewide Emergency Response Plan Integration
 

 
Illinois Emergency Operations
 
Plan
 

Illinois 
Emergency Operations Plan (IEOP)
. The purpose of this plan is to outline the 
mechanism for providing state assistance to local governments dealing with significant 
disasters.
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
34
 
 
 
 
Outlined within the IEOP are policies, concepts of operations, organizational structures 
and federal
-
state
-
local interfaces. The IEOP contains 
specific language pertaining to the 
provision of Health and Medical Services in response to emergencies and disasters.
 
 

 
IDPH Emergency Operations
 
Plan
 
The 
IDPH Emergency Operations Plan 
provides a framework for emergency preparedness 
activities of the depa
rtment. IDPH is prepared to respond with assistance in times of actual or 
threatened natural or manmade disaster and emergencies.
 
 
IDPH has developed policies, plans and procedures, which enable the agency to become 
aware of, gather additional information on and act upon a potential or real emergency. 
The 
IDPH Emergency Operations Plan 
is intended to establish policies to allow the 
de
velopment of appropriate procedures, which will ensure the coordination of emergency 
response activities.
 
 

 
Health and Medical Care Response
 
Plan
 
The overall goal of the 
Health and Medical Care Response Plan 
is to assist local health 
department, 
hospital, emergency medical services, and health care personnel and 
facilities in working together in a collaborative way and to provide support for health 
and medical response operations during emergency events.
 
 
The 
Health and Medical Care Response Plan 
outlines the framework for the 
communication and coordination of emergency medical services. The plan provides an 
organizational structure among hospitals and other health care facilities and their 
personnel, equipment and supplies during a mass casualty e
vent.
 
 

 
Illinois Strategic National Stockpile
 
Plan
 
The purpose of the 
Illinois Strategic National Stockpile Plan 
is to provide operational 
guidance for Illinois to implement statewide assets and to request, to receive, to organize, 
to distribute and to repa
ckage medical material pre
-
 
positioned by the Department of 

state/local emergency response authorities during a major event when state and local 
resources have been depleted or 
are unavailable.
 
 
Primary Direction and Control Points
 
Overall public health and medical direction and control and the coordination of input of all 
responding organizations to a pandemic influenza outbreak will be accomplished through the 
staffing and oper
ation of the following direction and control points.
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
35
 
 
 
 

 
State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC)
 
The 
SEOC
, located within the IEMA office in Springfield, serves as the strategic 
coordination point for a multi
-
agency state response for 
disasters and emergencies.
 
 
The 
SEOC
 
Communications Center is the designated primary 24
-
hour point of contact 
for state agencies and departments. The 
SEOC
 
is responsible for developing protective 
action recommendations for the governor and notifying the ap
propriate counties. The 
SEOC
 
is responsible for notifying representatives of the state agencies and departments 
designated to report to the 
SEOC
 
as outlined in the 
IEOP
.
 
 
Initial 
SEOC
 
objectives during an event are to:
 
a.
 
Identify staffing and 
initiate deployment of the UAC and UAC
 
team.
 
b.
 
Manage notification and deployment of IEMA and 
SEOC
 
liaisons and 
UAC
 
team.
 
c.
 
Advise affected jurisdictions of UAC team
 
deployment.
 
d.
 
Establish and maintain communications with local EOCs, FEMA and other 
elements as
 
required.
 
e.
 
Provide logistical/ground support to UAC
 
team.
 
f.
 
Develop, in conjunction with other state agencies and the affected local 
government(s), an initial impact
 
assessment.

Continuing 
SEOC
 
operational objectives are to:
 
a.
 
Determine need for 
gubernatorial disaster
 
declaration.
 
b.
 
Continue coordination of state resources and deployment of the UAC team.
 
c.
 
Maintain communications with FEMA, UAC(s), local EOCs and other 
elements as
 
required.
 
d.
 
Provide special logistical/administrative
 
support.
 
e.
 
Facilitate
 
redeployment of UAC team and

Illinois Department of Public Health Emergency Operations Center
 
(PHEOC)
 
The PHEOC is the designated point of contact for coordination and provision of updates 
on 
the status of public health and medical operations with the following entities:
 
o
 
SEOC
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
36
 
 
 
 
o
 
Joint Information Center
 
(JIC)
 
o
 
CDC
 
o
 
ASPR
 
The PHEOC will serve as the strategic coordination and policy center for public health 
and medical operations. The P
HEOC will determine the need for appropriate resources; 
develop an emergency response plan for surveillance, communication and vaccine 
management; assign actions to be undertaken by the department staff; and collaborate to 
resolve multi
-
jurisdictional coor
dination issues.
 
 
The issuance of health and medical guidance and the coordination of news releases and 

influenza outbreak will be the responsibility of the PHEOC.
 
 

 
Joint In
formation
 
Center
 
The purpose of a Joint Information Center (JIC) is to coordinate the flow of information 
about the incident and related response issues among agencies, and to provide a single 
information source for the media, business community and genera
l public. The JIC is an 
element of the 
SEOC
 
where the emergency response is coordinated. Communication 
among agencies, to the media and to the public, must be rapid, accurate and effective, 
and a JIC provides a forum for the necessary information exchange.
 
Public information 
among and from all responding agencies, emergency operations centers, political 
jurisdictions and the media are handled through this center, thereby allowing the 
coordination of information from all sources, and reducing or eliminating 
conflicting 
information and
 
rumor.
 
 
The establishment of a JIC may be necessary under one or more of the 
following circumstances:
 
a.
 
Multiple local, state and federal agencies are involved in the information 
dissemination about a possible
 
crisis.
 
b.
 
The 
volume of media inquiries appears to overwhelm the capabilities of the 
public information officer within the emergency operations
 
center.
 
 
2.0
 
Preparedness
 
Multiple stakeholders have important roles in pandemic influenza preparedness and response. 
Stakehol
ders include federal departments and agencies, public health organizations, state and 
local health departments and laboratories, private health care organizations, influenza vaccine 
and antiviral manufacturers, and vaccine distributors and vaccinators. Not
 
every section of this 
plan will be immediately relevant to each of the stakeholders. The guidelines and annexes have 
been compiled into a single plan with the goals of enhancing understanding and improving 
coordination between public and private sectors a
nd at different levels of the health care system. 
This structure also emphasizes that an effective response to an influenza pandemic requires 
planning, infrastructure and action at many levels, and by many groups.
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
37
 
 
 
 
 
Planning and Coordination
 
The directors of IDPH and IEMA have jointly established a multijurisdictional, multi
-
 
agency 
committee responsible for developing recommendations for improving pandemic influenza 
preparedness and response. At a minimum, the members of the committee represe
nt the 

practitioners, first responders, local emergency management, and appropriate nongovernmental 
and private sector organizations.
 
The purpose of this group is to:
 
 
Bri
ng together representatives of groups likely to be adversely affected by an influenza 
pandemic, and/or which, due to legal responsibilities, the fulfillment of their respective 
stated missions, or the reasonable expectations of the public, are obligated to
 
take part in 
the response to such an
 
eventuality.
 
 
Foster open discussion and civil debate among these representatives in an effort to 
address difficult and as
-
yet
-
unresolved issues; develop clear, feasible, and consensus
-
based recommendations on these iss
ues whenever possible; and, deliver such 
recommendations to the IDPH director for
 
consideration.
 
 
Provide a forum for IEMA and IDPH to update group members on the steps that state 
government is taking to prepare for an influenza
 
pandemic.
 
 
Provide the 
IDPH director and other state government executives, as well as planners, 
with insight into the needs and capabilities of stakeholder groups throughout the state, 
taking into account geographic differences and a variety of other pertinent social and 
demogr
aphic variables; thereby eliminating, or at least reducing, disparities in the 
delivery of critical services during a pandemic or other potentially catastrophic public 
health
 
situation.
 
 
Conduct regular reviews of this plan and supporting documents to ensur
e relevance 
and accuracy of information and procedures. Oversee changes to this
 
plan.
 
 
Participate in the development of state pandemic influenza exercises. The group also 
will review after action reports for these exercises and provide recommendations 
abou
t future preparedness and response
 
activities.
 
 
Make recommendations to the IDPH director on steps necessary to maintain the safety of 
workers involved in responding to an influenza
 
pandemic.
 
 
Planning Guide for State and Local Officials (Annex 1 of Nationa
l Pandemic Influenza 
Response Plan): 
This guide is intended to convey important items to consider in the planning 
process, with each jurisdiction assuming responsibility for deciding how each item is 
implemented. It also is recognized that a number of acti
ons taken by state and local agencies will 
be contingent upon the development of national policies and procedures, many of which are 
presently under development.

Event Modeling Planning Tools
 
Flu Aid 2.0
 
is designed to help state and local
-
level public health officials plan, prepare and 
practice for the next influenza pandemic by modeling the impact a pandemic might have on 
their community. The software is 
designed to provide a range of estimates of impact in terms of 
deaths, hospitalizations and outpatient visits due to pandemic influenza (before interventions are 
applied). The software does not provide any description of how the pandemic will spread, i.e.,
 
when a specific community will be affected.
 
 
FluSurge
 
is a spreadsheet
-
based model, which provides hospital administrators and public 

 
in demand for hospital
-
based services during the next 
influenza pandemic. FluSurge estimates the number of hospitalizations and deaths of an 
influenza pandemic and compares the number of persons hospitalized, the number of persons 
requiring ICU care, and 
the number of persons requiring ventilator support during a pandemic 
with existing hospital capacity.
 
 
Training and Education: 
IDPH will be the lead agency for the development of a training and 
education plan. The plan developed by IDPH will outline a 
mixture of presentations and 
independent studies to increase the knowledge of key officials, first responders, emergency 

influenza. Minimum training and educa
tion activities will:
 
 
Provide relevant information to organizations with preparedness and response duties in 
this
 
plan.
 
 
Update the IDPH Web page to include information for governmental
 
and 
nongovernmental staff and the general public on pandemic
 
influenza.
 
 
Regularly present pandemic preparedness overviews at statewide conferences of key 
officials, first responders, and public health and health care
 
providers.

Risk and Emergency 
Communications
 
Effective response to pandemic influenza will require the general public to make proper and 

IDPH and IEMA, include:
 
 
 
Develop clear, accessible and und
erstandable information sheets on pandemic influenza 
and related threats. The information should be posted on state and local websites and 
distributed in hard copy to the general
 
public.

Version 5.1
 
39
 
 
 
 
 
Develop initiatives by the governor to educate the 
public on personal and family 
protective
 
measures.
 
 
Develop emergency alert system messages and media fact sheets prior to 
pandemic
 
influenza.
 
 
Identify and train key state government spokespersons on pandemic influenza and 
activities the state will perform 
during pandemic
 
influenza.
 
 
Establish an informational hotline for the general public with capacity adequate to meet 
anticipated peak call volume (CDC recommends enough lines to simultaneously handle 
1percent of a jurisdictions population); develop a 
means of tracking and categorizing 
types of calls to identify trends, rumors and misinformation
 
 
Other Key Activities for Pandemic Preparedness
 
When it becomes available, pandemic influenza vaccine will be a federal asset. Updated 
information regarding vac
cine purchase and distribution is available on the USHHS website.
 
 
 
Influenza antiviral medication stockpiling
 

 
Influenza
-
specific antiviral medications, 
when administered as prophylaxis, can be effective at preventing influenza and, as 
treatment, in reduc
ing complications, hospitalization and death. Factors that will be 
considered include feasibility of public sector distribution during a pandemic; potential 
impacts, costs, and
 
cost
-
effectiveness of a larger stockpile; the shelf life of stockpiled 
drugs; a
nd other logistical issues.
 
 
 
Priority groups for vaccine and antivirals when supply is limited relative to potential 
demand
 

 
An initial list of suggested priority groups consistent with achieving the 
public health goals outlined above will be developed by
 
USHHS. Prioritization 
schemes should have some flexibility to accommodate local needs.
 
 
In addition, there are decisions that cannot be made until a pandemic is imminent and 
surveillance and epidemiological data are available to determine 
transmission patterns, the 
geographic spread of disease, and segments of the population at highest risk of infection and 
complications. Nevertheless, knowledge of the types of decisions that will be needed can 
promote planning, facilitate development of op
tions, and guide infrastructure development and 
data collection to support
 
decision
-
making.

Surveillance System and Laboratory Analysis
 
 

 
Phases 1 and 2

Interpandemic
 
phase
 
Illinois will ensure a well
-
functioning interpandemic surveillance system that adheres 
to national standards, as defined by
 
CDC.
 
IDPH will continue the seasonal 
influenza surveillance system using the CDC ILI
-
 
Net, 
I
-
NEDSS, Illinois Vital Records System (IVRS) and IDPH Outbreak Reporting System 
(ORS). The system also utilizes sentinel providers throughout the state who report levels 
of influenza
-
like illness (ILI)
 
and/or specimens from ILI patients for additional testing at 
the IDPH laboratories. ILI reporters provide information through the CDC ILINet system 
on a weekly basis. I
-
NEDSS, the state communicable disease surveillance reporting 
system, is used to receiv
e reports of reportable influenza cases (intensive care unit 
admissions of influenza cases and pediatric influenza deaths). IVRS is used to identify 
deaths due to influenza, while ORS is a system developed for outbreak reporting, 
including for influenza ou
tbreaks.
 
Revisions to the Illinois contingency plan for enhancing virologic and disease
-
 
based 
surveillance systems in the event of a novel virus or pandemic will address several 
issues including:
 
a.
 
Laboratory surge
 
capacity
 
b.
 
Laboratory safety
 
issues
 
c.
 
Increased frequency of
 
reporting
 
d.
 
Assess means to count or estimate numbers of influenza
-
related
 
deaths
 
e.
 
Monitor hospital bed capacity through the IDPH Hospital Bypass
 
System
 
f.
 
Monitor surveillance data and investigate cases with potential exposures to the 
new
 
strain
 
g.
 
Increase laboratory surveillance for specimens that are not the current 
circulating
 
strain(s)
 
 

 
Phase 3

Novel influenza virus identified; no human
-
to
-
human
 
spread
 
Illinois will continue surveillance activities as described in previous phases.
 
 
Il
linois will enhance interpandemic influenza surveillance activities by:
 
a.
 
Increasing case detection among persons who recently traveled to the outbreak 
area and present with clinical illness possibly caused by influenza, including 
pneumonia, acute respirator
y distress syndrome or other severe respiratory 
illness. Appropriate specimens should be collected to diagnose influenza 
infection. In some situations, if the novel influenza virus is a highly pathogenic 
avian strain, such as with
 
the
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.1
 
42
 
 
 
 
2004 H5N1 influenza virus in Asia, local hospital laboratories should not 
attempt viral isolation because of the potential risk the strain could spread. 
Specimens should be sent to the state public health laboratory or to CDC where 
isolation and sub typing
 
can be done under more stringent biocontainment 
conditions. Influenza infection can be diagnosed locally using antigen detection, 
immunofluorescence or PCR. Guidance will be provided by CDC appropriate to 
each specific novel virus alert.
 
b.
 
Ensuring 
interpandemic influenza surveillance activities are underway regardless 
of the time of year and participating laboratories and sentinel providers are 
reporting data to CDC each
 
week.
 
c.
 
Subtyping influenza A viruses identified in high
-
risk clinical specimens 
and 
report any influenza A viruses that cannot be subtyped to CDC immediately.
 
d.
 
Obtaining reagents from CDC (when they become available) to detect and 
identify the novel
 
strain.
 
e.
 
Recruiting and enrolling additional sentinel providers, if necessary, to reach 
the 
minimum of one regularly reporting provider for every
 
250,000 persons.
 
f.
 
Monitoring and instituting recommendations from CDC for any additional 
surveillance activities that should be undertaken given the specific 
circumstances. Reviewing contingency plan
s for further enhancing influenza 
surveillance if efficient person
-
to
-
person transmission of the novel virus is
 
confirmed.
 
 

 
Phases 4 and 5

Some level of human
-
to
-
human transmission confirmed
 
but not
 
widespread
 
Illinois will continue surveillance activities
 
as described in previous phases. If 
efficient person
-
to
-
person transmission of a novel influenza virus is confirmed, the 
following additional surveillance enhancements will be
 
considered:
 
a.
 
Assess the need to screen travelers arriving in the United 
States from affected
 
countries.
 
b.
 
Investigate the epidemiology of all early cases either originating in the United 
States or imported into the
 
country.
 
c.
 
At hospitals and emergency departments, increase laboratory diagnosis of 
influenza, including 
through use of rapid antigen detection tests, for persons 
with compatible clinical syndromes, particularly among those who may have 
had recent exposure at the site of an outbreak. Laboratories should institute plans 
for testing substantially more specimens
 
than usual. CDC will provide 
guidelines to assist with triage of specimens for testing and for choosing which 
isolates to send to
 
CDC.
 
d.
 
U.S./WHO collaborating laboratories report test results daily to
 
CDC.

Vaccine Delivery and Targeted High
-
Risk Population
 

 
Phases 1 and 2

Interpandemic
 
phase
 
a.
 
Enhance influenza vaccination coverage levels in traditional high
-
risk groups, 
particularly subgroups in which coverage levels are low (e.g., 
minorities and 
persons younger than 65 years of age with chronic underlying medical 
conditions). Increasing routine, annual vaccination coverage levels in these 
groups will further reduce the annual toll of influenza and will facilitate access 
to these pop
ulations when the pandemic
 
occurs.
 
b.
 
Use Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations 
to enhance pneumococcal vaccination coverage levels in traditional high
-
risk 
groups to reduce the incidence and severity of secondary bacterial
 
pneum
onia.
 
c.
 
Define the process by which review and modification of the national 
recommendations for vaccine priority groups will
 
occur.
 
d.
 
Consider state
-
specific modifications or refinements in priority groups, 
depending on local circumstances. For 
example, there may be specific groups of 
persons in selected states whose absence, due to influenza illness, could affect 
public safety, security or result in the disruption of essential community 
services. Examples of such unique, special
-
skill groups mig
ht include nuclear 
power plant operators, air traffic controllers at major airports, workers who 
operate drinking water
 
and

waste water plants and workers who operate major telecommunications or 
electrical grids.
 
e.
 
Determine size of priority g
roups and develop a plan for
 
vaccinating them.
 
f.
 
Develop a plan for providing influenza vaccine to priority groups in the event of 
severe or moderately severe vaccine shortages. Consider the potential need to 
prioritize within priority groups. Frontline heal
th care workers will need to be
 
defined.
 
g.
 
Develop a plan for mass vaccination of the general public once sufficient amounts 
of vaccine are available, including identification of vaccine administration 
personnel. Elicit written commitments from agencies and 
institutions that plan to 
provide vaccinators. Security issues should be taken into
 
consideration.
 
h.
 
Ensure that appropriate legal authorities are in place that will allow for 
implementation of major elements of the proposed administration plan. This 
includes working with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional 
Regulation to extend the scope of practice to authorize certain licensed health 
care givers to administer the
 
vaccines.
 
i.
 
Ensure contingency plans have been considered for emergency 
distribution of 
unlicensed vaccines using emergency investigational new drug (IND) 
provisions. Such provisions call for strict inventory control and recordkeeping, 
along with completion of a signed consent
 
form.
 
j.
 
Coordinate the proposed vaccine distribution
 
plan, as recommended by CDC, 
with bordering jurisdictions, including counties, states and unique populations.
 
k.
 
Engage state health coordinator (and/or state adverse events coordinator) in 
planning for the monitoring and investigation of adverse 
events.
 
l.
 
Identify a data management system to track vaccine supply, distribution, and use 
and to track administration of two doses of vaccine (if recommended). States with 
vaccine distribution systems and immunization registries may be able to modify 
their 
systems for these purposes. Other options include adapting other state
-
specific systems or the pre
-
event vaccination system.  Key pieces of information 
to collect to facilitate reminder notification for second doses include name, date of 
birth, address and
 
telephone
 
number.
 
m.
 
Review, exercise and modify vaccine distribution plans as needed on a periodic 
basis. This is applicable if the state performs its own centralized distribution. 
During 2009A(H1N1)A response activities, the CDC contracted with 
McKesson Sp
ecialty to provide centralized distribution on behalf of the United
 
States.

Purpose
 
 
The purpose of the Surveillance and Detection Annex is to outline the procedures that will be 
utilized by the state to:
 

 
Determine when, where and which 
influenza viruses are circulating in
 
Illinois
 

 
Determine the intensity and impact of influenza activity on defined health 
outcomes, and identify unusual or severe
 
outbreaks
 
 
Planning Assumptions and Considerations
 
Although the current influenza 
surveillance system achieves the objectives of monitoring 
influenza viral strains and identifying outbreaks, interpreting surveillance data poses several 
challenges. Because most cases of influenza are not identified etiologically (i.e., not confirmed as 
i
nfluenza by a laboratory test) it is impossible to specifically count all influenza cases, 
hospitalizations and deaths. Laboratory testing of all influenza
-
like illness (ILI) cases would be 
prohibitively expensive and time consuming given the large number 
of such cases that occur 
each year. Since infections other than influenza can cause ILI, accurate counts of influenza cases 
cannot be determined based on the frequency of a clinical syndrome. Finally, many persons 
infected with influenza do not seek medica
l care and therefore remain unidentified.
 
For these reasons, statewide influenza activity is measured indirectly by (1) the number of 
specimens tested that are positive for influenza, (2) health care provider visits for ILI 
compared to baseline level and (
3) outbreaks in congregate settings.
 
These indicators are measured on a regional basis to determine the overall statewide activity 
level. Deaths in pediatric cases and ICU admissions also is tracked as part of the surveillance 
system.
 
 
An additional challe
nge for monitoring the effect of influenza viruses on hospitalization or 
mortality is that many severe influenza
-
related illnesses or deaths are due to secondary bacterial 
infections (most commonly bacterial pneumonia) or worsening of chronic diseases. Bec
ause 
surveillance data have not been able to capture all influenza
-
related hospitalizations and deaths, 
and because the pneumonia and influenza category also includes many persons who do not have 
influenza, estimating the burden of influenza requires condu
cting specific studies and using 
mathematical modeling. These studies evaluate differences in health outcomes, death or 
hospitalization during the influenza season and time periods before and after influenza season for 
defined diagnostic codes. Excess pneu
monia and influenza mortality or hospitalizations typically 
have been evaluated but underestimate the impact of influenza by omitting deaths related to 
worsening of a chronic condition, such as congestive heart failure following an influenza 
infection. By 
contrast, analyzing seasonal differences in all causes of mortality would likely 
overestimate the role of influenza in excess winter mortality. For these reasons, developing a 
means to
 
 51
 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.
1
 
 
 
 
count or estimate numbers of 
influenza
-
related deaths is challenging and can only be achieved 
if time and resources allow.
 
 
The severity of the influenza outbreak may strike as many as 25 percent to 40 percent of state 
employees. State agencies must be prepared to implement their resp
ective Continuity of 
Operations Plans to ensure uninterrupted essential services to the public. During a pandemic, 
surveillance and epidemiology staff will need to surge from other areas of the IDPH Division of 
Infectious Diseases and, therefore, surveilla
nce activities for other diseases may have to cease or 
be scaled
 
back.
 
 
Concept of Operations
 
 
Public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and 
dissemination of health data essential to the planning, implementat
ion and evaluation of public 
health practice. Surveillance supports disease control interventions, estimates the burden of a 
disease or injury, provides information on the natural history of conditions, determines the 
distribution and spread of illness, ge
nerates hypotheses and stimulates research, and aids in the 
evaluation of prevention and control measures. Syndrome surveillance is an investigational 
approach to surveillance typically using electronic databases, which may assist in both early 
identificat
ion of an outbreak, and defining the size and scope of a recognized health event.
 
 
Seasonal Influenza Surveillance
 
 
IDPH conducts a seasonal influenza surveillance system using the CDC ILI
-
Net, Illinois 
National Electronic Disease Surveillance System 
(I
-
NEDSS), Illinois Vital Records System 
(IVRS) and IDPH Outbreak Reporting System (ORS). The system also utilizes sentinel 
providers throughout the state who report levels of influenza
-
like illness (ILI) and/or specimens 
from ILI patients for additional t
esting at the IDPH laboratories. ILI reporters provide 
information through the CDC ILI
-
Net system on a weekly basis. For specimen submission, 
IDPH has been working to achieve specimen submission goals established by CDC. I
-
NEDSS, 

isease surveillance reporting system, is used to receive reports of 
reportable influenza cases (intensive care unit admissions of influenza cases and pediatric 
influenza deaths). IVRS is used to identify deaths due to influenza, while ORS is a system 
devel
oped for outbreak reporting, including influenza outbreaks throughout the state. The ILI
-
Net and laboratory sentinel system is most robust during the influenza season with only a few 
participating during the summer, but efforts continue to be made to incre
ase year

round 
reporting.
 
 
Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System
 
The Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (I
-
NEDSS) will be used for 
hospitals, doctors and other health care providers to electronically report infecti
ous diseases to 
the state and to local health departments. The system was initially launched in March 2004 so the

Syndromic Surveillance data will be available to provide situational awareness on the number of 
emergency department visits due to influenza like illness. 
By October
 
2014, hospitals in Illinois 
will be required to send syndromic surveillance data to IDPH. The aggregation tool used to 
summarize these syndromic data is evolving. As an alternative until the BioSense aggregation 
tool matures, the Essence tool, e
mployed by health departments in the metro Chicago and St. 
Louis areas (providing data for 42 hospitals), will be used to provide situational awareness 
during a
 
pandemic.

Purpose
 
 
The purpose of the Laboratory Testing Annex is to outline the procedures and 
capabilities of the IDPH state laboratory.
 
 
Planning Assumptions and Considerations
 
It is assumed that the IDPH Division of 
Laboratories will be involved in routine influenza 
surveillance throughout the development of an influenza pandemic. Laboratory staff is routinely 
requested to work overtime hours to provide epidemiologic information to characterize the 
spread of an illnes

capability to test up to 700 specimens per day, but it will require a shift in personnel resources to 

(e.g., sexually 
transmitted disease, enteric outbreak, vaccine preventable disease) would need to be 
discontinued or postponed to reach this goal. Testing this quantity of specimens will need to be 
carefully considered and the plan to utilize local health 
departments as gatekeepers should be 
used to ensure specimens are properly authorized for testing. If this quantity of testing is needed, 
additional clerical support will be necessary in the laboratory for both data entry and answering 
phone calls from
 
sub
mitters.
 
 
Concept of Operations
 
 
IDPH laboratory personnel have been trained and are assessed to perform the CDC real time 
polymerase chain reaction assay that is approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to 
detect the presence of the in influenza 
virus. As such, IDPH continues in its role as the 

IDPH laboratories will be testing Influenza types A and B; type A subtypes H1, H3 avian H5, 
H7;
 
and
 
2009A(H1N1)pdm.
 
Each of 
the IDPH three laboratories (Carbondale, Springfield and Chicago) has the capability to perform 
these tests. Current maximum capacity is approximately 700 specimens per day for the three 
laboratories during an influenza outbreak, as
suming staff is working overtime and other testing 
areas have been discontinued or delayed. The laboratories are maintaining supplies to rapidly 
gear up if an outbreak
 
occurs.
 
 
The objectives of the IDPH Division of Laboratories are (1) to provide maximum 
useful 
epidemiological data to assist in guiding the application of control efforts, (2) to detect any 
significant shift in the virus type, and (3) to assist CDC in the detection of antiviral resistant 
strains of influenza by forwarding positive influenza 
samples from Illinois to CDC. Currently, a 
shift in virus or antiviral resistance must be determined by
 
CDC.

It is important to note that once a pandemic strain has been identified, testing every individual 
with compatible symptoms may not b
e necessary. Instead, the IDPH Division of Laboratories 
may be more useful in the early stages of a pandemic testing a relatively smaller number of 
specimens to help epidemiologists determine the spread of disease. Authorization for testing of 
individual s
pecimens will follow the procedure currently employed by the IDPH divisions of 
Infectious Diseases and Laboratories. All specimens must be authorized for testing by the 
Division of Infectious Disease or applicable local health department. Samples or specim
ens 
submitted to the laboratory without proper authorization will not be tested.
 
Laboratory staff will contact the submitter and determine if the sample/specimen will be 
returned or destroyed. For more information on laboratory testing and authorization, r

Purpose
 
 
The purpose of the Antiviral and Vaccine Purchase and Distribution Annex is to 

plan to distribute and to dispense antiviral prophylaxis and therapy and vaccine during an 
influenza pandemic. In the annex, considerations for stockpiling of these pharmaceuticals will be 
established. The primary goals of antiviral and v
accine use and therapy would be to decrease 
adverse health impact (morbidity and mortality), maintain a functioning health care system, and 
reduce social and economic disruption, supporting overall pandemic response
 
goals.
 
 
Planning Assumptions and Conside
rations
 
 
It is important to note that antiviral agents are an adjunct and not a substitute for vaccine. 
Vaccine remains the principal means for preventing influenza
-
related morbidity and mortality. 
Appropriately used, antiviral agents are assumed (but not 
proven) to prevent or treat infection 
in the recipient, but their effect on the spread of an established pandemic remains undefined.
 
When a pandemic first strikes, vaccine will likely not be ready for distribution. Currently, 
vaccine requires 
6
-
to
-
8
-
months to produce. Once the first lots of vaccine are available, there is 
likely to be much greater demand than supply. Vaccine will be

administered to persons in priority groups, in accordance with existing 
recommendations as 
listed in the USHHS Pandemic Influenza Plan and issued by the ACIP. The current prioritization 
has been developed with the primary goal to decrease health impacts, including severe morbidity 
and death. During a pandemic, the specific com
position of some of the priority groups may differ 
according to the state and/or community needs to preserve societal functions.  In addition, 
priority groups should be reconsidered when a pandemic occurs and information is obtained 
regarding the epidemiol
ogy of the virus and vaccine
 
effectiveness.
 
Later in the pandemic, vaccine supply will approximate demand, and vaccination of the full 
at
-
risk population can occur.
 
Although the effectiveness of currently available antivirals against a pandemic influenza s
train 
remains undefined, stockpiling of such drugs is considered prudent. Stockpiling of large 
quantities of antiviral drugs is most likely best performed at the federal level, in order to avoid 
a scenario where state and local jurisdictions, as well as ho
spitals, corporations and individuals, 
are competing for what is currently a scarce resource.
 
The USHHS is stockpiling antivirals (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and is allocating them to states 
based on population. The current public sector stockpile target i
s 81 million regimens: 6 million 
regimens for containment and for slowing the entry of pandemic disease in the United States, 
and 75 million regimens for treatment.

Concept of Operations
 
 
Strategies for Antiviral Drug Use
 
The guidance is not a requirement, but is designed to define a strategy for antiviral drug 
stockpiling and use. The working group recommends the following 
strategies and 
settings for antiviral use to meet these goals:
 
 
1.
 
Contain or suppress initial pandemic outbreaks overseas and in the United States with 
treatment and post
-
exposure prophylaxis (PEP) among individuals identified as 
exposed to pandemic influenz
a and/or geographically targeted prophylaxis in areas 
where exposure may
 
occur.
 
 
2.
 
Reduce introduction of infection into the United States early in an influenza 
pandemic as part of a risk
-
based policy at U.S.
 
borders.
 
 
a.
 
Treatment of persons with 
pandemic illness who present for care early in their 
illness and would benefit for such
 
treatment.
 
 
b.
 
Prophylaxis of high
-
risk health care workers and emergency services 
personnel (e.g., fire, police, employees providing critical services at utilities, 
such 
as waste water and drinking water, power, gas), for the duration of 
community pandemic
 
outbreaks.
 
 
c.
 
Post
-
exposure prophylaxis of workers in the health care and emergency services 
sectors who are not at high risk, persons with compromised immune systems 
who 
are less likely to be protected by vaccination, and persons living in group 
settings, such as nursing homes and prisons, if a pandemic outbreak occurs at 
that
 
facility.
 
 
The National Vaccine Advisory Committee unanimously adopted a series of recommendation
s 
for priority use of antiviral medications. The recommendations considered pandemic response 
goals, impacts of a pandemic, annual influenza disease, data on impact of antiviral drugs and 
the existing recommendations for pandemic vaccine use. The following
 
listing outlines the 
prioritization with the primary goal of the response to decrease severe morbidity and death. 
Minimizing social or economic impacts were considered secondary and tertiary goals.

Illinois recognizes the national plan points out a number of unresolved issues that also will 
need 
to be defined within the state; guidance for health care workers on when and when not to treat, 
use of antivirals in infants (risk/benefit), specific definitions and estimated population size of 
each group, and ability to stratify the populations.
 
 
Pa
ndemic Vaccine Supply
 
Influenza vaccine availability will change during the course of a pandemic. Pandemic response 
strategies will vary with vaccine supply. Four vaccine supply levels can be defined.
 
 
Stage 1: No Vaccine Available
 
At the beginning of a pa
ndemic, it is likely that no vaccine will be available. Interventions to 
decrease the burden of influenza illness will be limited to measures taken to decrease the 
spread of infection (such as quarantine, closing schools, canceling public events, infection
 
control in hospitals and long
-
term care facilities); to prevent infection by using antiviral 
chemoprophylaxis; and to effectively treat those who become ill. The duration of this period 
will depend on several factors:
 
a.
 
Time of year when the pandemic strain
 
is
 
identified.
 
b.
 
Time required for vaccine development and
 
licensure.
 
 
Stage 2: Limited Vaccine Supply
 
When first available, the pandemic influenza vaccine supply will be less than that required to 
protect the susceptible population. The duration of this sh
ortage stage cannot be predicted 
but could include the entire first pandemic season. Several planning issues are of particular 
importance for this phase of vaccine shortage:
 
a.
 
Vaccinate persons in identified priority groups, in accordance with existing 
recom
mendations.
 
b.
 
Plan for rapid, efficient, and equitable distribution of vaccine will need to be 
formulated. Provide a second dose of vaccine, if required for
 
immunity.
 
 59
 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.
1
 
 
 
 
c.
 
Develop approach to inform priority groups about the 
availability of vaccine and where 
to receive it; and to educate the public regarding vaccine priorities and their rationale 
will be
 
needed.
 
d.
 
Develop systems to monitor vaccine supply, distribution and
 
use.
 
e.
 
Develop systems to monitor and 
investigate adverse
 
events.
 
 
Stage 3: Adequate Vaccine Supply
 
During this period, pandemic vaccine supply will match the need and ability to distribute and 
administer vaccine. This will allow a shift from targeted vaccination of priority groups to 
widespre
ad vaccination, possibly of the entire population.
 
Strategies for widespread vaccination could include public sector vaccination clinics and/or 
administration of vaccine by private sector providers. Despite increased vaccine supply, efforts 
to ensure fair,
 
equitable and orderly distribution remain important goals. USHHS will issue 
national recommendations to aid in this process. Plans for widespread vaccination during a 
pandemic should identify potential barriers to vaccination of racial and ethnic minority
 
populations and develop strategies to overcome them. These may include holding vaccination 
clinics in disadvantaged areas, vaccinating at community sites such as places of worship, 
involvement of local opinion leaders to promote vaccination, and developme
nt of focused 
educational messages and
 
materials.
 
 
Stage 4: Vaccine
 
Excess
 
In this stage, vaccine supply will exceed that needed to protect the U.S. population, which may 
occur if pandemic influenza vaccine production levels remain high after much of the 
p
opulation already has been vaccinated. This stage is unlikely to occur before the second or 
third wave of pandemic disease.
 
 
Pandemic Vaccine Priorities
 
Identifying priority groups for vaccination is important because vaccine supply, when 
initially 
available, will be less than demand. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee and the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) unanimously support a series of 
recommendations that were based on the following assumptions: morbidity and m
ortality, 
impact on health care system, workforce, critical infrastructure and vaccine production capacity. 
The following listing summarizes the priority populations. Illinois recognizes that state and 
local needs may require some modification to the exist
ing recommendations upon assessment of 
the epidemiology of the virus and its impact on communities. In addition, priority groups will 
have to be specifically defined as to which functions are indeed critical to infrastructure and 
defined by their size with
in the state.
 
 
Goal 1: Protect persons at highest risk for influenza mortality
 
Direct protection of high
-
risk persons is the strategy on which annual influenza vaccination is 
based. Historically, older adults and those who have underlying diseases have bee
n at highest 
risk of death for seasonal influenza. However, the 2009A (H1N1)pdm virus affected a 
younger population. Recommendations for administration of 2009A(H1N1)pdm vaccine were 
based on several factors, including current disease patterns, populations
 
most at
-
risk for severe 
illness based on the
 
 60
 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.
1
 
 
 
 
trends seen in illness, hospitalizations and deaths, how much vaccine was expected to be 
available, and the timing of vaccine availability. The groups recommended to receive the novel 
2009A(H1N1)pdm influenza vaccine included
 

 
Pregnant women 
because they were at higher risk of complications and could 
potentially provide protection to infants who cannot be
 
vaccinated.
 

 
Household contacts and caregivers for children younger than 6 months of
 
age 
because younger infants are at higher risk of influenza
-
related complications and cannot 
be vaccinated. Vaccination of those in close contact with infants less than 6 months old 

 
virus.
 

 
Health car
e and emergency medical services personnel 
because infections among 
health care workers have been reported and this can be a potential source of infection for 
vulnerable patients
. 
Also, increased absenteeism in this population could reduce health 
care syst
em
 
capacity.
 

 
Children from 6 months through 18 years of age 
because many cases of novel 
2009A(H1N1)pdm influenza have occurred in children and they are in close contact with 
each other in school and day care sett
i
ngs, which increases the likelihood of dise
ase
 
spread.
 

 
Young adults 19 through 24 years of age 
because many cases of novel 
2009A(H1N1_pdm influenza have occurred in these healthy young adults and they 
often live, work and study in close proximity, and they are a frequently mobile
 
population.
 

 
Persons aged 25 through 64 years who have conditions associated with higher 
risk of medical complications from
 
influenza.
 
In February 2010, the ACIP voted to expand the recommendations for seasonal influenza 
vaccination. The following summarizes current AC
IP recommendations for vaccination against 
influenza:
 

 
All persons older than 6 months of age should be vaccinated
 
annually.
 

 
Protection of persons at higher risk for influenza
-
related complications
 
should continue 
to be a focus of vaccination efforts as pro
viders and programs transition to routine 
vaccination of all persons 6 months of age or
 
older.
 
 
When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering 
vaccination to persons who
 
-
 
Are aged 6 months to 4 years (59
 
months)
 
-
 
Are 50 years 
of age or
 
older
 
-
 
Have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except 
hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic or metabolic 
disorders (including diabetes
 
mellitus)
 
-
 
Are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medica
tions or by 
human immunodeficiency
 
virus)
 
-
 
Are or will be pregnant during the influenza
 
season
 
-
 
Are aged 6 months to 18 years and receiving long
-
term aspirin therapy and
 
who therefore 
might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus
 
infection
 
-
 
Are residents of nursing homes and other chronic
-
care
 
facilities
 
-
 
Are American Indians/Alaska
 
natives

years of age or younger and adults 
50 years of age or older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts
 
of children 
younger than 6 months of
 
age
 
-
 
Are household contacts and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them 
at higher risk fo
r severe complications from
 
influenza
 
 
In addition, promotion and support of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination among high
-
risk populations should be considered during the interpandemic period. Increased use of 
pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine may decrease rates of secondary bacterial infections 
during a pandemic. The Illinois Department of Public Health will provide annual notification to 
the Illinois Department on Aging of the importance of pneumococcal vaccination.
 
 
Goa
l 2: Decrease transmission of infection to those at highest risk for influenza 
mortality (provide indirect protection)
 
Indirect protection is achieved by decreasing the spread of infection to those at high risk. Family 
members of older adults and 
persons with chronic illnesses are recommended for annual 
influenza vaccination in order to decrease disease in their high
-
risk contacts. Vaccinating health 
care providers and staff in institutional settings also can decrease transmission to persons at hig
h 
risk. Vaccination of school
-
aged children has been recommended by the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices as part of the routine pediatric schedule as a strategy to decrease 
transmission within a community. Collaboration within the community wit
h schools, day cares 
and higher education institutions is critical to decrease transmission. The decision to dismiss 
students should be made locally and should balance the goal of reducing the number of people 
who become seriously ill or die from influenza
 
with the goal of minimizing social disruption 
and safety risks to children sometimes associated with school dismissal.
 
Goal 3: Maintain the ability to provide quality health care, implement pandemic response 
activities and maintain vital community service
s
 
Protecting the health care workforce is essential to providing the quality of care that will 
decrease morbidity and mortality. This is particularly important at times of vaccine shortage 
when good clinical care will be the most important intervention to 
reduce influenza health 
impacts. Maintaining the capacity to implement pandemic response activities, for example, by 
protecting those in public health, vaccine production and administration; and preserving public 
safety (e.g., police and fire department se
rvices) also are high priorities.
 
 
Goal 4: Maintain other important community services
 
Achieving the pandemic influenza preparedness and response plan goals of decreasing social 
and economic impacts requires maintenance of important community services, suc
h as utilities 
and transportation. Such decisions can best be made at state and local levels.
 
 62
 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.
1
 
 
 
 
In order to maintain effective community services, the following prioritization schedule will 
be followed within Illinois, upon completed vaccine a
dministration to those groups 
previously identified:
 
 
-
 
Agencies involved in the Strategic National Stockpile
 
Plan
 
-
 
Agencies involved in this Pandemic Influenza Response
 
Plan
 
-
 
Agencies and sectors that fall within identified critical infrastructure/key resourc
es 
central to maintaining continuity of
 
operations
 
 
Goal 5: Protect the susceptible population at large
 
Investigational New Drug (IND) Use:
 
State and local health departments should be prepared to 

manner. In the event of rapid pandemic spread and standard safety and efficacy testing is not 
complete, IND
 
vaccine may be needed. Illinois would follow the provisions as stated by FDA.
 
 
Once the demand for vaccine for the prioritized groups has been met at the local level, programs 
and providers also should begin vaccinating everyone from 25 through 64 
years of age. Current 
studies indicate that the risk for infection among persons age 65 or older is less than the risk for 
younger age groups. However, once vaccine demand among younger age groups has been met, 
programs and providers should offer vaccinati
on to people 65 years of age or
 
older.
 
 
Vaccine Delivery Process for Illinois
 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will provide guidance to states and 
certain major U.S. cities (project areas) regarding procurement and delivery process
es of 
pandemic vaccines and ancillary supplies. During 2009A(H1N1)pdm the federal government 
provided 2009A(H1N1)pdm vaccine and ancillary supplies at no cost to the states. In Illinois, 
IDPH, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), and other healt
h care providers 
directed the distribution of pandemic vaccine and supplies. The CDC allocated the 
2009A(H1N1)pdm vaccine and supplies utilizing a population
-
based formula. Illinois 
represents about 4.3 percent of the U.S. population. Chicago is about 1 pe
rcent with the rest of 
the state making
 
up
 
3.3 percent. CDPH determined distribution within the city limits of Chicago. IDPH determined 
distribution for all areas of the state outside of Chicago.
 
 
A tiered approach will be used for the delivery of vaccine 
in Illinois, excluding Chicago. This 
approach is based on the 2009A(H1N1)pdm response activity. The following are the tiers to be 
used.
 
 
Tier
 
1
 
Centralized
 
Distribution
 
CDC will utilize a centralized distribution method much like that used for the Vaccines
 
for 
Children (VFC) program and existing seasonal influenza vaccine distribution. CDC utilizes 
McKesson Specialty (one of the three largest pharmaceutical companies in the United States) for 
centralized distribution of vaccine through the VFC program.
 
Duri
ng the 2009A(H1N1)pdm response, 2009A(H1N1)pdm vaccine and supplies were also 
distributed via this method to an estimated 90,000 delivery sites nationwide.
 
 63

March 2020
 
Version 5.

Tier
 
2
 
Distribution via the IDPH Immunization Promotional Center
 
(IPC)
 
IDPH will 
maintain its capacity to redistribute vaccine and supplies to providers in order to 
supplement any identified federal centralized system. The IDPH Immunization Promotional 
Center (IPC) has been in operation since 1994, and serves as a customer service and 
accountability center for the Illinois VFC program. The IPC served as an off
-
site warehouse and 
distribution center prior to 2008 and continues to maintain resources to re
-
establish distribution 
and support to vaccine providers on an ad hoc or emergency ba
sis. The IPC also maintains cargo 
vans that can be used to transport vaccines and supplies to providers as needed.
 
 
Tier
 
3
 
Distribution via the Strategic National Stockpile
 
Plan
 
If Tier 3 is needed, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) Plan will be imple
mented. This plan 
consists of utilizing identified state partners. Under the SNS Plan and distribution mechanism, 
the Illinois Department of Transportation is the lead agency for transportation and the Illinois 
State Police provides security for delivery v
ehicles. The Illinois Department of Corrections and 
the Illinois National Guard provide back
-
up transportation and security. Illinois has identified 
three receiving, staging and shipping (RSS) sites strategically located within the state to receive 
federal
 
assets, and a fourth to receive vaccines. The CDC has validated these sites. From one 
RSS site in the state, the designated state agencies will transport the medical materials to pre
-
identified Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs). At the RDCs, the materi
al will be transferred 
to smaller vehicles, if needed, and deployed to the affected area. Each certified local health 
department and every participating hospital in the state has identified a primary and secondary 

aterial.

Purpose
 

movements or activities of persons for the purpose of preventing or controlling the spread of a 
dangerous infectious disease.
 
 
Scope
 
The restriction of movement and/or activities involves the ability of state and local jurisdictions 
to be prepared 
legally
, 
procedurally 
and 
materially 
to contain and monitor: exposed individuals 
or those suspected of being exposed (term: quarantine); infected individuals (term: isolation); 
defined groups or locations, such as individual schools, workplaces, malls and public 
transit 
systems, as determined on a case by case basis (term: focused measures to increase social 
distance); and entire communities, ranging from voluntary widespread cancellation of most 
activities (term: snow days), eliminating large gatherings of people
, such as sporting events, 
shutting down other places where people congregate, such as schools and places of employment, 
or enforced restriction of movement into and out of defined
 
areas.
 
Key Terms
 
Isolation
: 
Isolation is the separation of a person or a gr
oup of persons infected or believed to be 
infected with a contagious disease to prevent the spread of infection. Ill persons are usually 
isolated in a hospital, but they also may be isolated at home or in a designated community
-
based 
facility, depending on
 
their medical needs.
 
Quarantine
: 
Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement or activities of persons 
who are not ill, but who are believed to have been exposed to infection, for the purpose of 
preventing transmission of diseases. Modes of ap
plication include:
 

 
Persons are usually quarantined in their homes, but they also may be quarantined in 
community
-
based
 
facilities.
 

 
Quarantine can be applied to an individual or to a group of persons who are exposed at a large 
public gathering or to 
persons believed exposed on a conveyance during international
 
travel.
 

 
Quarantine also can be applied on a wider population or geographic
-
level basis (e.g., snow 
days) with the voluntary or enforced prohibition of movements or activities. This measure is 
us
ually not 
technically 
considered quarantine because it is not 
directly 
linked to a known or 
highly suspect exposure (at best, the basis might be some degree of likelihood of exposure due 
to circumstantial or indirect evidence, such as high disease prevalen
ce in a particular town or 
neighborhood ). These options are described and compared in the attachment following this 
annex (Attachment
 
8

Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.

Quarantine (a period of isolation to prevent disease spread) is 
not 
effective in controlling 
multiple influenza outbreaks in large, immunologically naïve populations, because the 
disease spreads too rapidly to identify and to control chains of transmission
. Even if 
quarantine were 
somewhat 
effective in controlling influenza in large populations, it would 
not be feasible to implement and enforce with available resources, and would damage the 
economy by reducing the workforce. Most people will voluntarily qua
rantine themselves in 
their
 
home.
 

 
Quarantine may be of limited use in slowing the spread of disease during the 
earliest 
stages of 
influenza outbreaks, 
only if special circumstances apply
. For example, were a case of 
influenza
-
like illness to be identified 
in an isolated group, such as the passengers and crew of 
an airplane, public health officials could prevent or slow the spread of disease to other groups
 
by:
 
-
 
Quarantining all passengers and crew members for several
 
days
 
-
 
Transferring all who become ill to i
solation wards for
 
treatment
 
-
 
Treating all influenza
-
like illness in the wider community with 
suspicion
 
 
The probability of this scenario is low in all circumstances, but diminishes over time as an 
influenza pandemic spreads. Quarantine should not be 
confused with methods used to prevent 
outbreaks of illness in health care facilities, such as patient segregation, or with methods used to 
slow disease spread in large populations, such as school
 
closures.
 
 
Planning Assumptions and 
Considerations Part 1: Preparedness
 
Legal preparedness 
for movement restriction measures includes:
 
a.
 
Adequate statutory authority for all movement restrictions and monitoring measures 
countenanced in response plans along with the full support of this authori
ty via 
administrative rules, when
 
appropriate.
 
b.
 
Statutory provisions addressing compensation and job security risks and issues that 
those subjected to movement restriction measures could potentially
 
face.
 
c.
 
An understanding of what the federal government can 
do under sections 361 (impose and 
enforce measures) and 311 (cooperate with and aid state and local jurisdictions that 
impose and enforce measures) of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC
 
264).
 
Procedural preparedness 
for movement restriction measures inc
ludes
:
 
a.
 
Protocols for imposing, maintaining (including enforcing when applicable), monitoring 
and terminating each type of movement control provided for by law and countenanced in 
response plans; drafts of written orders, notices, letters, checklists and ot
her documents 
supporting these activities, when
 
applicable.
 
b.
 
Protocols for coordinating state government
-
imposed movement restriction measures 
with those either currently in force or being contemplated by local subdivisions.

plans.
 
e.
 
Protocols and/or agreements supporting statutory provisions addressing 
compensation and job security risks and
 
issues.
 
Materia
l preparedness 
for movement restriction measures includes:
 
a.
 
Isolation and quarantine facilities may range from identification of owned/leased 

what types of facilities w
ould be most
 
appropriate.
 
b.
 
Food and other basic necessities (state or local government may not
 
necessarily directly 
supply these things, but whichever entity is imposing the restriction has a responsibility 
to ensure necessities are provided, and they are s
afe, are available in sufficient quantities 
and are
 
timely.
 
c.
 
Quantities of medical supplies adequate to support those in home or facility isolation 
or quarantine, including antibiotics, masks and other medical consumables, 
antivirals, thermometers and other
 
symptom monitoring supplies/equipment.
 
d.
 
Personal protective and communication equipment for workers placed at risk because 
their job duties require them to impose, maintain/enforce, monitor and/or terminate 
movement restriction
 
measures.
 
e.
 
Phone lines, 
facilities and adequate paid and/or volunteer staff to operate influenza 
hotlines to provide advice on whether to stay home or to seek medical care, to answer 
questions about pandemic influenza and to monitor trends, such as rumors and 
common
 
misperception
s.
 
f.
 
Basic internal infrastructure components necessary to support the selection and 
imposition of restrictions on activities and/or movements
 
include:
 
o
 
Response thresholds for implementation of different containment
 
measures;
 
o
 
communication
 
strategies;
 
o
 
logistics (supplies, security, staffing, essential services for persons in 
isolation and
 
quarantine);
 
o
 
protocols for case and contact management;
 
and
 
o
 
databases for case and contact
 
management.
 
 
Planning Assumptions and Considerations Part 2: Res
ponse
 
Decisions to invoke quarantine should be made only after careful consideration of three major 
questions examined within the specific context of a particular outbreak:
 
Do public health and medical analyses warrant the imposition of 
large
-
scale 
quarantine?
 
Are the implementation and maintenance of large
-
scale quarantine feasible?
 
 69
 
Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.
1
 
 
 
 
Do the potential benefits of large
-
scale quarantine outweigh the possible adverse 
consequences?
 
 
Each of these considerations is 
examined in more depth below.
 

 
Decision makers must consider whether implementing movement and/or activity restrictions 
at the time of discovery of disease outbreak has a reasonable scientific chance of 
substantially diminishing the spread of
 
disease.
 
Quest
ions officials should answer when evaluating movement and activity restriction options 
include:
 
a.
 
What is the cause? (infectious
 
agent)
 
b.
 
How communicable is it?
 
(transmissibility)
 
c.
 
How is it transmitted? (mode of
 
transmission)
 
d.
 
When and for how long is it trans
mitted? (infectious
 
period)
 
e.
 
How long is its incubation
 
period?
 
f.
 
Who is
 
susceptible?
 
g.
 
Who is especially at risk of severe
 
illness?
 
 

 
Decision makers must consider whether movement and activity restrictions with a 
reasonable scientific basis are 
logistically feasible (this consideration applies to local, state 
and federal decision
 
makers).
 
a.
 
Is there a plausible way to determine who should be subjected to movement and/or 
activity
 
restrictions?
 
b.
 
Are resources available to enforce the
 
restrictions?
 
c.
 
Can the restricted group be confined for the duration during which they could transmit 
the
 
disease?
 
 

 
Even when the imposition of movement or activity restrictions is scientifically appropriate 
and logistically feasible, decision makers 
must consider whether the potential benefits of 
quarantine outweigh the possible adverse consequences. The following is by no means an 
exhaustive list of things to be
 
considered:
 
a.
 
What are the health risks to those
 
quarantined?
 
b.
 
What are the consequences if 
the public declines to obey quarantine
 
orders?
 
c.
 
What are the consequences of restricting commerce and transportation to and from the 
quarantine
 
area?
 
 
Concept of Operations
 
The movement and activity restriction options available to decision makers leading t
he 
response to an influenza pandemic depend upon: 1) the legal authority to take certain actions; 
and 2) the capabilities to support the taking of those actions.
 
Pertinent legal authorities are identified and described below. The capabilities to carry out 
various courses of action based on these authorities are established throughout this plan and 
the other IDPH and Illinois emergency response plans listed in the concept of operations 
section of this plan.

Track and contain disease 
through case investigation and implementation of 
control
 
measures
 
Section 2 of the Illinois Department of Public Health Act (20 ILCS 2305/2) provides that 
IDPH is required to investigate the causes of and take means to restrict and suppress 
dangerously con
tagious or infectious diseases, especially when existing in epidemic form (20 
ILCS 2305/2(a)). Whenever a dangerously contagious or infectious disease becomes, or 
threatens to become epidemic, in any locality, and the local board of health or local 
authori
ties neglect or refuse to act with sufficient promptness or efficiency, IDPH may 
enforce such measures as it deems necessary to protect the public health. IDPH has broad 
rulemaking authority for the preservation and improvement of the public health (20 ILC
S 
2305/2(a)), and all local boards of health, health authorities and officer, police officers, 
sheriffs, and other officers or employees of the state or any locality are required to enforce 
such rules and regulations so adopted (20 ILCS
 
2305/2(a)).
 
 
IDPH has adopted the Control of Communicable Diseases Code (77 Ill. Adm. Code
 
690.100 
et
 
seq.
), which requires that reporting entities report diseases and conditions to the 
local health departments who, in turn, report the same to IDPH. The Control of 
Comm
unicable Diseases Code additionally sets out the appropriate control measures to be 
taken with respect to controlling cases and contacts of dangerously contagious or infectious 
diseases listed therein. Subpart H of the Control of Communicable Diseases Code
 
outlines 
the procedures for ordering and implementation of public health measures, including, but not 
limited to, isolation, quarantine and closure.
 
 
With regard to local public health agencies, the authority to control communicable diseases is 
stated bro
adly in their respective enabling statutes. (See 55 ILCS 5/5

Gain access to and utilize facilities and
 
property
 
Upon the
 
declaration of a disaster pursuant to Section 7 of the IEMA Act (20 ILCS 3305/7), 
the governor may exercise, among other things, the following emergency powers: 
recommend the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened 
area
 
within the state if the governor deems this action necessary (20 ILCS 3305/7(a)(6)); 
prescribe routes, modes of transportation, and destinations in connection with evacuation (20 
ILCS 3305/7(a)(7)); and control ingress and egress to and from a disaster ar
ea, the 
movement of persons within the area, and the occupancy of premises therein (20 ILCS 
3305/7(a)(8)).
 
 

 
Appropriate private property for public
 
use
 
Upon the declaration of a disaster pursuant to Section 7 of the IEMA Act (20 ILCS 3305/7), 
the governor 
may, on behalf of the state, take possession of, and acquire full title or a lesser 
specified interest in, any personal property as may be necessary to accomplish the objectives 
set forth in Section 2 of the act, including airplanes, automobiles, trucks, t
railers, buses and 
other vehicles; coal, oils, gasoline and other fuels and means of propulsion; explosives, 
materials,

equipment and supplies; animals and livestock; feed and seed; food and provisions for 
humans and animals; 
clothing and bedding; and medicines and medical and surgical supplies; 
and to take possession of and, for a limited period of time, occupy and use any real estate 
necessary to accomplish those objectives; but only upon the undertaking by the state to pay 
j
ust compensation as provided in the act. (20 ILCS 3305/7(a)(4)). Subsection 7(a)(4) sets 
forth a procedure for providing for just compensation.
 
 
Additionally, IDPH is authorized to order a person to be quarantined or isolated or a place 
to be closed and ma
de off limits to the public to prevent the probable spread of a 
dangerously contagious or infectious disease until such time as the condition may be 
corrected or the danger to the public health eliminated or reduced in such a manner that no 
substantial dan

 
 

 
Impose isolation, quarantine, and
 
closure
 
I
DPH has supreme authority in matters of quarantine, and may declare and enforce 
quarantine when none exists, and may modify or relax 
quarantine when it has been 
established (20 ILCS 2305/2). IDPH can issue immediate orders, without prior consent or 
court order, for isolation, quarantine and closure of facilities when necessary to protect the 
public from a dangerously contagious or infec
tious disease. Within 48 hours, IDPH must 
gain consent of the person or owner of the place or request a court
 
order.
 
 
IDPH is authorized to order a person to be quarantined or isolated or a place to be closed and

infectious disease until such time as the condition may be corrected or the danger to the 
public health eliminated or reduced in such a manner that no substantial danger to the 

sts (20 ILCS 2305/2(b)). No person may be ordered to be 
quarantined or isolated and no place may be ordered to be closed and made off limits to the 
public, however, except with the consent of the person or the owner of the place or upon the 
order of a cour
t of competent jurisdiction (20 ILCS 2305/2(c)). In order to obtain a court 

welfare are significantly endangered and all other reasonable means of correcting the 
problem
 
have been exhausted and no less restrictive alternative exists (20 ILCS 2305/2(c)). 
Subpart H of the Control of Communicable Diseases Code outlines the procedures for 
ordering and implementation of public health measures including, but not limited to, 
iso
lation, quarantine and closure.  IDPH has explicitly delegated its authority to order 
isolation, quarantine and closure to certified local health
 
departments.
 
 
As previously noted, with regard to local public health agencies, the authority to control 
commu

Purpose
 
Effective emergency and risk communications is essential to supporting the public health 
response and to help 
build public trust, confidence and cooperation.
 
This is accomplished by providing timely, accurate, consistent and appropriate information to 
the general public, news media, health care providers and other key partners during a 
pandemic influenza outbreak.
 
 
Planning Assumptions and Considerations
 

 
An influenza pandemic will generate intense and sustained demand for information from 
the public, health care providers, policy makers and the
 
news media.
 

 
Informing health care providers and the public about influe
nza disease and the course of 
the pandemic, the ability to treat mild illness at home and the availability of vaccine will 
be important to ensure appropriate use of medical resources and avoid possible panic or 
overwhelming of vaccine delivery
 
sites.
 

 
Effec
tive communication with community leaders and the news media also is 
important to maintain public awareness, avoid social disruption and provide 
information on evolving pandemic response activities. State spokespersons need to 
acknowledge the anxiety, dist
ress and grief people will experience during a major 
public health crisis, such as a
 
pandemic.
 

 
Communication efforts will be directed to rapid sharing of appropriate, up
-
to
-
 
date 
information on the progression of the outbreak, the possible 
disruptions to routines and 
events, and contingency
 
measures.
 

 
The public must be provided as much information as possible to help them understand 
uncertainty is part of the process and answers may change as new information and 
science becomes
 
available.
 

 
Em
ergency communication is approved by the governor or his
 
designee.
 

 
In the event of an emergency, emergency communication systems will be
 
used as 
described in the Emergency Operations
 
Plan.
 

 
All government and non
-
government resources will utilize a 
single source of 

 
emergency.
 

 
Federal partners at CDC and USHHS will provide regular updates regarding the 
pandemic.
 

 
Local information will be provided to IDPH through existing reporting
 
systems from 
local so
urces, such as local health departments, hospitals,
 

 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan

offices and schools.
 

 
Coordination of release of 
information among federal, state and local health officials is 
critical to help avoid confusion that can undermine public trust, raise fear and anxiety, 
and impede response measures. The state will utilize
 
a Joint Information Center that will 
communicate d

 
Center.
 
 
Concept of Operations
 
 
Preparedness
 
The state will provide needed health/risk information to the public and key partners for use 
during a pandemic influenza event to provide the basis for a well
-
coordinated
 
and consistent 
communication strategy. This objective will be achieved by conducting the following
 
activities:
 
a.
 
Complete a plan for crisis and emergency risk communication (CERC) and information 
dissemination to educate the news media, public, partners and
 
stakeholders regarding 
risks associated with the real or apparent threat and an effective
 
response.
 
b.
 
Conduct trainings, drills, exercises and other collaborative preparations to assess 
communications capacity, needs and readiness. Ensure channels of 
communication are 
in place to rapidly share appropriate information with the public, partners and
 
stakeholders.
 
c.
 
Complete a plan for activities to meet the specific needs of functional needs 
populations that include, but are not limited to, people with disa
bilities, people with 
serious mental illness, minority groups, the non
-
English speaking, homeless people, 
children and the
 
elderly.
 
 
Other preparedness activities conducted by the Office of the Governor, supported by IDPH, 
IEMA and IDCMS, include:
 
a.
 
Develop 
clear, accessible and understandable communication resources on pandemic 
influenza, using existing CDC materials as a starting point. Ensure the CDC or WHO 
information is accurate before preparing the resources. The information would be 
posted on state and
 
local websites and be available to the general public in hard
 
copy.
 
b.
 
Provide public education campaigns and materials about pandemic flu and ways people 
can protect themselves, their families and others, including information on self
-
care and 
psychological
 
well
-
being.
 
c.
 
Develop emergency alert system messages and basic news media materials to serve as 
background documents prior to a pandemic influenza
 
outbreak.
 
d.
 
Identify and train state government spokespersons on public health crisis response and 
risk communi
cation principles to effectively communicate helpful, informative 
messages in a timely manner during a pandemic influenza outbreak.
 
e.
 
Implement and maintain a general informational hotline with capacity to
 
meet

anticipated peak call 
volume (CDC recommends enough lines to simultaneously handle 
1 percent of a jurisdictions population), in collaboration with the CDC
-
 
INFO telephone 
line and other information lines (e.g., Illinois Poison Center); and develop a means of 
tracking and catego
rizing types of calls to identify trends, rumors, misconceptions and 
inaccurate information.
 
 
Response
 
Flow of Public Information
 
The Office of the Governor maintains a staff experienced in news dissemination and media 
relations, and works in collaboration with the IDCMS Office of Communications and 

regarding their response activities through the 
SEOC
.
 
Media briefings will be conducted regularly at the Joint Information Center (JIC) to provide 
updates and to offer reporters opportunities to ask questions. The governor may choose to 
hold media briefing
s in other locations, such as the state Capitol, 
SEOC
 
or areas particularly 
hard hit by the pandemic. In addition, either accompanying the governor or at additional 
briefings, other state pandemic subject
-
matter experts (e.g., the state public health direc
tor, 
the IDPH infectious diseases physician or the IDPH state epidemiologist) will be made 
available to the media.
 

from the 
SEOC
 
or the JIC, and they will be distribute
d by IDCMS (Illinois Information
 
Services).
 
IEMA staff at the JIC will ensure that the news releases are 
shared with the other organizations at the JIC, with the county EOCs and local health
 
departments.
 
Coordination of the release of information by the st
ate, health care providers, 
contiguous states, volunteer agencies providing disaster relief, the federal government, 
and affected local governments will be critical to building public trust and confidence.
 
The state will disseminate timely, accurate and co
nsistent information to local health 
departments and health care providers on treatment and care of patients, vaccine 
prioritization and use, use of antiviral medications, infection control practices, isolation and 
quarantine procedures, clinical and labor
atory diagnostics, travel control authority, 
stigmatization management and legal issues related to the
 
pandemic.
 
 
Rumor Control
 
When widespread rumors, inaccuracies or misperceptions are identified, the JIC will be 
consulted so correct information can be p
romptly communicated to the public through the 
media. These miscommunications may be identified in media broadcasts, in print media or 
through public inquiries.
 
If it is determined to be necessary, IEMA will establish a rumor control hotline telephone 
syst
em in collaboration with IDCMS. The hotline staff will be prepared to answer questions 
from the public dealing with basic facts regarding health and medical considerations during 
a pandemic influenza event. The hotline staff also

will be able
 
to provide numbers or connections to other telephone lines that have been 
established. Questions that cannot be answered by hotline staff will be recorded and 
provided to appropriate organizations or subject matter experts.
 
Special public information need
s may be identified through the hotline calls.
 
The state will utilize state websites to provide updates on the pandemic outbreak, frequently 
asked questions, disease control and other public statements.
 
Communication between federal, state and local 
response agencies will be conducted through 
appropriate and available secure data communication exchange systems.

Purpose
 
This annex presents recommended planning guidelines for response to mass fatalities incidents. 
A mass fatalities incident is any situation in which there are more fatalities than can be handled 
in a timely and 
professional fashion using regularly available local resources to address a single 
incident or multiple incidents. This section outlines the procedures state will implement to 
address the collection, handling, storage, and the disposal of mass
 
fatalities.
 
 
Planning Assumptions and Considerations
 

 
The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic killed approximately 40 million people. It is estimated 

-

deaths. Based on current modeling from 

fatalities range from 7,907 to 47,462 based on low
-
to
-
 
high severity flu
 
deaths.
 

 
The establishment of a unified command structure during the initial stages of the 
incident will coordinate all responding organizati
ons and promote a more expedient 
and efficient conclusion to the
 
incident.
 

 
All agencies or individuals involved in responding to an incident should be NIMS 
compliant.
 

 
The success or failure to provide adequate response to a mass fatality incident is 
depend
ent upon recognition of the needs and effective incident command. The sheer 
magnitude of a major incident necessitates establishment of effective command systems, 
including delegating authority for management functions at the site(s). The concept of 
operat
ions should provide for implementation of incident management functions and 
personnel to be employed during the response phase of the
 
plan.
 

 
Initially, in the event of an influenza outbreak, the responsibility of fatality management 
will reside at the local
 
level. Planning and response may require the participation and 
cooperation of local agencies, such as, but not limited
 
to:
 
1.
 
County coroners/medical
 
examiners
 
2.

directors

As the outbreak escalates to the pandemic level, local officials will call upon the 
state 
agencies to provide resources and
 
assistance.
 

 
At such time that the number of fatalities exceeds the capabilities and capacity of state 
agency response, Illinois will request federal mortuary response assistance.
 

 
Agencies assigned primary and support
 
roles and responsibilities for fatality 
management will develop agency
-
specific policies and procedures to fulfill the 
objectives identified in this
 
plan.
 

 
The state will utilize the Illinois Disaster Management System for preparedness, response 
and 
recovery operations related to fatality
 
management.
 

 
The governor will exercise all authorities available under the Illinois Emergency 
Management Agency Act [20 ILCS 3305] related to fatality
 
management.
 

 
The state public health director will exercise all au
thorities available under the 
Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil Administrative Code of 
Illinois [20 ILCS 2305] with regard to fatality
 
management.
 
 
Concept of Operations
 
 
Preparedness
 
A mass fatalities incident involves 
many tasks and normally will become very complex.
 
No single response agency can handle the breadth and depth of tasks to be 
accomplished. The need for planning teamwork and an appreciation of the roles of other 
agencies is crucial to effective working rela
tionships, both during the planning before the 
incident occurs and during the incident itself. The establishment of a unified command 
structure during the initial stages of the incident will coordinate all responding organizations 
and promote a more expedi
ent and efficient conclusion to the
 
incident.
 
 
In a disaster situation, identification of the dead is a critical issue. The ultimate 
responsibility for the collection, identification, storage and release of deceased victims will 
lie with the coroner (or me
dical examiner), as per the regulations and rules of the state.
 
 
Each response organization should have its own specific standard operating procedures or 
guidelines for dealing with a mass fatalities incident that are an annex to the county Emergency 
Opera
tions Plan (EOP). This part of the EOP should be coordinated with other agencies likely 
to have a role in a mass fatality incident to facilitate the response and avoid duplication or 
omission of functions. All response organizations' plans should be integr
ated into the county 
EOP.
 
 
Mutual aid agreements should be completed in advance so all parties concerned are fully 
aware of the authorities, responsibilities, resources and limitations of other
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.

83
 
 
 
responding organizations. It is highly recommend
ed that such agreements be developed in 
writing for providing additional resources. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency 
(IEMA) may be referenced in the county EOP and other planning documents as the point of 
coordination for state and federal resource
s.
 
 
The planning process and the plan itself are not static, but dynamic. No plan is ever final 
because personnel changes, exercising, operations and re
-
evaluation should result in 
appropriate revisions.
 
 
An essential part of the county EOP should be a 
resource listing. The list will contain all the 
resources that may be needed for a mass casualty event, location of the resource, method of 
delivery to the scene, a point of contact and a 24
-
hour phone number, if available. This list 
should be reviewed on 
an annual basis to assure accuracy and currency.
 
 
To keep mass fatality plans practical and efficient, drills and exercises should be 
conducted routinely. Individual response units should conduct operational drills within 
their response area, while 
functional and full
-
scale exercises should be conducted to 
assure plans, agencies and individuals are briefed, exercised and reviewed in a timely 
manner. Changes to the plans are based on drill and exercise comments. All hazard 
scenarios can include these 
elements.
 
 
Response
 
Communications
 
Redundant communications links between the incident command post, the
 
incident site and the staging areas, media area, and the county and/or municipal emergency 
operations center (EOC) should be established and maintained
 
throughout the incident. 
Cellular phones, high frequency (HF) radios and ""hard wire"" phones installed by a phone 
company have all been used in mass fatality incidents.
 
 
Temporary
 
Morgues
 
In a pandemic influenza outbreak, once local capabilities are exceed
ed, the state will assist local 
government in securing resources and assist with the establishment of temporary
 
morgues.
 
A temporary morgue should be established after determining that the expected number of cases 
will exceed the capacity of normal operati
ons. Upon assessment by IEMA, and in consultation 
with DMORT, the coroner/medical examiner will determine the possible need for a temporary 
morgue. A recommendation will be made to the coroner or medical examiner to seek approval 
for receiving federal assi
stance in the identification and mortuary service effort, including site 
location for a temporary morgue.
 
The temporary morgue should be located close to the area where large numbers of 
deceased are located and should have:

The morgue site should be guarded 
during use and fenced in or locked for security of remains 
and personal property. It should be removed from public view, not be a school or other sites of 
local potential for long
-
term sensitivity and have sufficient space for body identification 
procedure
s. It also should be capable of being partitioned for separation of functions, such as 
body handling, property inspection, X
-
ray, autopsy, records maintenance and interviewing. 
Access to multiple telephones is a vital consideration for permitting temporary
 
morgue 
personnel to acquire victim
 
information.
 
Potential temporary morgue sites can be in existing mortuaries, hangers, large garages, 
National Guard armories or other areas without wooden floors. After a morgue site is 
established, 
coordinators should obtain refrigerated trailers, as necessary. The trailers can be 
moved to whatever location is directed by the coroner. If refrigerated trailers are not available, 
the coroner should arrange for railroad refrigeration cars, vans or other
 
cold storage to aid in 
the preservation of bodies. The functions carried out at each morgue site will be determined by 
the circumstance. (In the planning process, it should be understood whether the coroner or the 
county is responsible to obtain this type
 
of equipment.) Careful consideration should be given 
to the selection of a morgue site. The quality of the facility is more important than having it 
located in close proximity to the incident
 
site.
 
Consideration should be given to assigning a person to ea
ch body or body part. This person 
will become the tracker for that body, accompanying the body through the identification 
process and being accountable for appropriate paperwork. This technique has been 
successfully used in several recent mass fatality inc
idents.
 
However, exceptional care should be exercised in selecting those to perform this task. 
Relatively few people have been exposed to dramatically mutilated bodies (e.g., at an 
airplane crash) and many will be unable to handle the psychological aspect 
of the problem. 
Funeral directors who have expertise in handling family members or others who would not 
be overly stressed by this task should be considered. No one person should have a 
prolonged assignment at this task.
 
 
Documentation
 
Documentation refers to maintaining timely and accurate records concerning 
personnel involved and expenditures of time and money.
 
Record all incoming personnel, equipment and time of arrival. Issue identification and a task 
description to people reporting 
to the staging area(s). As noted, preparing a method of 
identification before an incident will save time and help reduce confusion at the scene. 
Document all expenditures, ordered goods, services or equipment, to include the requestor, 
arrival and departur
e times.

DMORT Activation
 
Upon notification of a mass fatalities incident, 
IEMA may request that the U. S. Public Health 
Service (USPHS) provide a team of experts to assist the coroner/medical examiner in assessing 
the situation to determine if federal government assistance is required. If the joint assessment 
so indicates, a rec
ommendation will be made to the coroner/medical examiner by IEMA and 
USHHS, and seek approval for receiving federal assistance. Upon concurrence, all or a portion 
of a disaster mortuary team (DMORT) may be provided to assist in victim identification, 
foren
sic and medical services, as well as mortuary services. If appropriate and requested, a 
portable morgue facility with necessary equipment and supplies to augment the local medical 

 
 
Dignity of the 
Deceased
 
While every effort to assist survivors should be attempted, the dignity of the deceased should 
be respected. All responding personnel should be informed on the proper procedures for 
marking the location of and removing the deceased, a legal respon
sibility of the coroner or 
medical examiner. After removal from the site, the deceased should be moved to the morgue, or 
to an intermediate area isolated from the public and media and guarded by law enforcement. 
The deceased must be treated with respect an
d dignity in all thoughts and actions. A bioethics 
committee will be consulted before any decisions are made on the mass burial or disposal of 
victims.
 
 
Safety Precautions
 
OSHA Standard 
-
 
Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens: Precautions for 
Emerg
ency Responders, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.1030, provides a 
good planning and training standard protection level.
 
The assumption behind the universal precautions for infectious disease control is that every 
direct contact with body fl
uids is infectious. Therefore, every person exposed to direct 
contact must take the precautions prescribed by the above standard. At a mass fatalities 
incident, this includes volunteers involved in search and recovery, transportation, body 
identification a
nd disposition.
 
In addition, monitoring should be conducted throughout the incident site for 
flammable or toxic vapors and radiation exposure.

Recovery
 
The physical removal of the dead is part of the total recovery process. An evacuation area
 
or 
morgue must be set up and staffed to receive the remains. The coroner or medical examiner is 
in charge of the recovery of both the bodies and their possessions, and could be assisted by 
some or all of the following agencies and organizations:

Purpose
 
 
To develop a strategy for preparing state and local workforce, through training and exercises, 
to deal with a 
pandemic. Test the operational efficiency of the training through exercises and 
drills to assure staff are aware of their role in the event of a pandemic.
 
 
Planning Assumptions and Considerations
 
 

 
All exercises will be designed and conducted in compliance 
with state exercise 
standards, as defined by the Illinois Terrorism Task
 
Force.
 

 
Local health departments are funded to prepare and respond to all hazardous events 
including a pandemic in local
 
communities.
 

 
Training and exercise requirements are 
outlined in annual preparedness grants to local 
health
 
departments.

staff.
 

 
All agencies and staff will be NIMS compliant, as required by executive
 
order.
 

 
Staff need to be 
trained and exercises conducted in advance so staff are aware of the 
NIMS and ICS structure and
 
roles.
 
 
Concept of Operations
 
An exercise is a focused practice activity that places participants in a situation simulating an 
emergency, disaster or other 
event that is catastrophic in nature, and requires them to function in 
the capacity that would be expected of them should such an event actually occur. As part of a 
comprehensive program, exercises are generally most effective when they build upon one 
anot
her in a manner that helps participants identify and ultimately meet specific operational 
goals. The overarching aim is to develop and to maintain competence in all pertinent emergency 
functions.
 
 
Orientation Seminar
 
The intent of an orientation seminar is
 
to give participants an overview or introduction to an 
identified risk, along with the current or proposed approach to addressing that risk. Its scope is 
limited to familiarizing participants with roles, plans, procedures or equipment, although it 
sometim
es is used to resolve some of the more elementary questions about communication, 
coordination and assignment of responsibilities. The format is typically a facilitated, informal 
discussion in a group setting.
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.

90
 
 
 
Drill
 
A drill is a 
coordinated, supervised exercise activity, normally used to test a single specific 
operation or function. With a drill, there is no attempt to coordinate organizations or fully 
activate an emergency response plan and operating structure. Its role in a comp
rehensive 
exercise program is to practice and to perfect one small part of the response plan and to help 
prepare for more extensive exercises designed to coordinate and to test several functions and 
involve a wider spectrum of participants. Drills also are
 
used to provide training with new 
equipment, to develop new policies or procedures, or to practice and to maintain current skills. 
The utility of a drill is its focus on a single, relatively limited portion of the overall emergency 
management system, ther
eby permitting a targeted, highly intensive look at a potential problem 
area.
 
 
Tabletop Exercise
 
A tabletop exercise is a facilitated analysis of an emergency situation in an informal, stress
-
free 
environment. It is designed to elicit constructive discussi
on as participants examine and resolve 
problems based on existing operational plans and identify where those plans need to be refined. 
The success of the exercise is largely determined by group participation in the identification of 
problem areas. There is
 
minimal attempt at simulation in a tabletop exercise. Equipment is not 
used, resources are only deployed on paper, and time pressures are not
 
introduced.
 
 
Functional Exercise
 
A functional exercise is an interactive, fully
-
simulated test of an organization

coordinated response to a stressful situation under time
-
pressured and more
-
or
-
less realistic 
circumstances.  This type of exercise gets its name from the fact it tests one or more functions of 

range of suitable objectives for this type of undertaking is 

policies, procedures, roles and responsibilities before, during or after an
 
event.
 
The intended audience 
for a functional exercise consists of policy, coordination and operations 
personnel who will practice responding in a realistic way to carefully planned and sequenced 

nts 
and problems that might occur in a real emergency, they must be scripted in a manner likely to 
cause participants to make decisions and then act on them. This complexity makes the 
functional exercise more difficult and time
-
consuming to design than dri
lls and tabletop 
exercises.
 
Participants will be required to make on
-
the
-
spot decisions and then act on them. These actions 
can generate a variety of actual consequences, such as responses from other players and 
resource shortages. These secondary conseque
nces can, in turn, further stimulate activity within 
the realm of the exercise environment.
 
Functional exercises make it possible to test several functions and to include several agencies 
or departments within an agency without incurring the cost of a 
full
-
scale exercise (described 
below). Thus, in almost all cases, a functional exercise is a prerequisite to a full
-
scale exercise. 
In some instances, taking part in a functional exercise also may serve as a full
-
scale exercise 
for a participating organiza
tion (e.g., a hospital may conduct its own full
-
scale exercise as part 
of a community
-
wide

functional exercise).
 
 
Full
-
scale Exercise
 
A full
-
scale exercise simulates a real event as closely as possible. It is designed
 
to evaluate the 
operational capabilities of emergency management systems in a highly stressful environment, 
and attempts to simulate the full spectrum of conditions that those with a response role might 
face. To accomplish these things, a full
-
scale exerc
ise must include the actual mobilization and 
movement of emergency personnel, equipment and resources. Ideally, a full
-
scale exercise 
should test and evaluate most of the functions provided for in the applicable emergency 
operations plan(s).
 
A full
-
scale e
xercise differs from a drill in that it coordinates the actions of several entities, 
tests several emergency functions and puts participants in actual v. simulated operating 
environments (e.g., state, state agency and/or local emergency operations centers;

Purpose
 
The purpose of the Public Health and Medical Surge Annex is to provide basic patient care and 
laboratory services to a greater volume during a pandemic influenza incident.
 
 
Planning Assu
mptions and Considerations
 
It is assumed that during an influenza pandemic, health care systems may be overwhelmed 
and laboratories will be unable to keep pace with testing demands.
 
 
Although planning has occurred, it is assumed health care, emergency medi
cal and 
laboratory staff may be ill and will subsequently reduce the available workforce.
 
 
It also is assumed there may be shortages of equipment and resources available to keep pace 
with increased demand for patient care and testing. It should be 
considered that there also 
might be shortages of items, such as gloves, respirators, ventilators and laboratory testing 
supplies.
 
 
There have been mutual
-
aid systems established and tested, both intrastate and interstate, but it 
should be 
considered that these mutual aid resources might be overwhelmed due to the pandemic 
influenza situation. The costs associated with stockpiling of supplies that may have limited shelf 
lives must be considered.
 
 
It is assumed citizens will seek medical care 
once signs and symptoms are experienced. It is 
also assumed the news media will impact the decisions of citizens to seek medical care versus 
staying at home.
 
 
Because it cannot be assumed citizens will follow directions during a perceived crisis situation,
 
local officials will be responsible for developing local plans and procedures to provide 
appropriate security to enable the jurisdiction to conduct response operations. It must be 
considered that all levels of government must have a strong public informat
ion program that 
will provide a level of confidence to the citizens.
 
 
It is assumed the local surge plans will be inadequate during a pandemic situation due to 
depending on other facilities or receiving assistance from a common vendor. It is assumed local 
health care facilities are creating and exercising surge plans.
 
 
It should be considered that routine laboratory testing statutory requirements be suspended in 
order to redirect staff and resources to pandemic influenza specimen testing.
 
 
It is assumed tha
t once the pandemic influenza strain has been identified there will be a 
continued laboratory surge in order to identify patients with that particular

influenza strain in order to better direct limited therapeutic resources. It is 
assumed hea
lth care and laboratory facilities will remain secure.
 
Concept of Operations
 

 
Collect information from local units of government, hospitals, laboratories, first 
responders and other state agencies regarding the actual or the anticipated demand 
for
 
services.
 

 
Communicate with federal agencies to determine the feasibility of acquiring 
resources through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact
 
(EMAC).
 

 
Confirm availability of alternate facilities, such as long
-
term care, outpatient surgical 
centers and 
non
-
traditional health care settings (e.g., school gymnasiums).
 

 
Issue public notice advising affected populations and local medical providers of 
appropriate actions to be followed to reduce or to limit the impact of surge on health care
 
facilities.
 

 
Activat
e various medical response teams, such as the Illinois Medical Emergency 
Response Teams (IMERT)and Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) units, where possible 
and appropriate, to assist with the surge
 
situation.
 

 
Provide guidance to health care and laboratory facilit
ies on appropriate actions.
 

 
Communicate with federal agencies to determine the appropriate guidance to be
 
distributed.
 

 
Utilize the Web
-
based hospital bed and resource availability
 
system.
 

 
After identification of the pandemic flu type during the 
initial stage of the pandemic, the 
medical necessity of continued, rapid testing of all suspected flu cases must be 
determined. This decision would be based, at least in part, on the availability and efficacy 
of antiviral drugs and the etiology of infectio
n with the pandemic strain. At one extreme, 
virtually all laboratory resources would be devoted to influenza testing, at the expense of 
routine and even mandated testing in other areas (e.g., newborn screening). At the other 
extreme, the laboratory would l
ikely be able to maintain essential services (i.e., business 
continuity) by providing at least mandated
 
testing.
 

 
In preparation for a possible surge in demand for laboratory testing, a coalition between 
the IDPH Division of Laboratories and private clinica
l laboratories should be made. 
Implementation of a dramatic surge in laboratory testing would still be dependent upon 
the availability of adequate supplies and staff to take advantage of the increased capacity 
that would be provided by such a coalition. Th
e IDPH labs also are working to confirm 
methods health care lab systems will be
 
employing.

The following is recommended before an influenza pandemic:
 

 
Given the potential of greatly increased demand for influenza testing at the IDPH 
laboratory, enhancement of the laboratory information management system (LIMS) is 
required in this area. Ideally, optical character recognition (OCR) forms will be used to 
enter patient information, and results will be sent electronically by fax from the L
IMS to 
the submitters. Currently, the latter capability is in place, but other priorities have 
prevented Information Technology (IT) from developing the OCR component. This 
component should be developed as soon as possible, since there will most likely not
 
be 
an opportunity for IT to make major LIMS changes during a rapid onset of pandemic 
influenza. In addition, the uncertainty of staffing during a pandemic would make manual 
data entry a major bottleneck in
 
testing.
 
 
Hospital Planning
 
Hospitals should be e
quipped and prepared to surge to maximum capacity to prepare for 1) a 
limited number of patients infected with a pandemic influenza virus, and 2) a large number of 
patients in the event of escalating transmission of pandemic influenza.

Primary
 
Agency:
 
IDPH 
Support Agencies: 
IDCMS, IEPA 
Purpose
 
Provide guidance on infection control measures (e.g., isolation precautions, PPE) to be 
implemente
d in order to limit the spread of pandemic influenza.
 
 
Planning Assumptions and Considerations
 
 
During an influenza pandemic, vaccine may not be available and antiviral agents may be in 
short supply. The ability to limit transmission of influenza in health
 
care settings will, therefore, 
rely heavily on the appropriate and thorough application of infection control measures.
 
 
Infection control practices for pandemic influenza are the same as for other human influenza 
viruses and primarily involve the 
application of standard and droplet precautions during patient 
care in health care settings (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient offices, emergency 
transport vehicles).
 
 
IDPH has general supervision of the interests of the health and lives of the pe
ople of the state. 
IDPH is the lead state agency for issuing infection control guidelines and policies, including 
recommendations for isolation precautions and type(s) of PPE to be worn. Guidelines issued by 
IDPH are based upon recommendations from the U.S
. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) and/or the World Health Organization (WHO).
 
 
CDC issues national infection control guidelines, which include recommendations for isolation 
precautions to prevent transmission of microorganisms and the type
(s) of PPE to be worn to 
reduce the risk of exposure to microorganisms.
 
 
During a pandemic, conditions that could affect infection control may include shortages of 
antiviral drugs, decreased efficacy of the vaccine, increased virulence of the influenza str
ain, 
shortages of single
-
patient rooms and shortages of PPE. These issues may necessitate changes in 
the recommended infection control practices for influenza. CDC and WHO will provide updated 
infection control guidance as circumstances dictate.
 
 
Local gov
ernments have primary responsibility to provide emergency medical and health 
services within their jurisdiction.
 
 
Local health departments have primary authority to implement and to enforce infection control 
measures for their citizens. Whenever a dangerou
sly contagious or infectious disease becomes 
or threatens to become epidemic, IDPH may enforce

102
 
 
 
additional measures as it deems necessary to protect the public health.

Settings where persons with pandemic influenza might seek and receive health care services 
(e.g., hospitals, emergency departments, 
outpatient facilities, residential care facilities and 
homes) should implement basic infection control principles to prevent the spread of pandemic 
influenza. Basic infection control principles include:
 
 
1)
 
Limit contact between infected and non infected pers
ons
 
through:
 
a)
 
Isolation precautions (i.e., standard precautions, droplet precautions, contact 
precautions and airborne precautions, as
 
indicated).
 
b)
 
Measures which promote spatial separation in common areas (e.g., sit or stand as far 
away as possible 

 
at lea
st 6 feet 

 
from potentially infectious
 
persons).
 
 
2)
 
Exposure control by reducing the potential for exposure to the pandemic influenza virus by 
persons caring for influenza patients in health care settings. Persons caring for infectious 
patients
 
should:
 
a)
 
Wear
 
a mask for close contact with infectious
 
patients.
 
b)
 
Use contact and airborne precautions, including the use of fit
-
tested N95 
respirators (or greater respiratory protection) and eye protection,
 
when

appropriate.
 
c)
 
Wear gloves (gown if 
necessary) for contact with respiratory
 
secretions.
 
d)
 
Perform hand hygiene after contact with infectious
 
patients.
 
 
3)
 
Control source by containing respiratory
 
secretions:
 
a)
 

-


 

 
b)
 
Promote use of masks by symptomatic persons in common areas (e.g., waiting rooms in 
physician offices or hospital emergency departments) or when being transported (e.g., 
in emergency
 
vehicles).
 
 
IDPH will provi
de guidance on adapting infection control practices to specific health care 
settings, including:
 

 
Nursing homes and other residential
 
facilities
 

 
Prehospital care (emergency medical services
 
[EMS])
 

 
Medical offices and other ambulatory care
 
settings
 

 
During the provision of professional home health care
 
services
 

 
During the care of pandemic influenza patients in the home or in alternative care sites 
(e.g., schools, auditoriums, conference centers,
 
hotels)
 
IDPH will provide recommendations for infection 
control in schools, work places and 
community settings.
 
All support agencies will provide services as indicated in other plans developed under 
referenced authorities in support of this
 
annex.
 
 
Definition of Infection Control
-
related
 
Terms
 
 
Standard 
Precautions
 
Standard precautions are infection prevention and control practices that apply to all patients 
regardless of diagnosis or presumed infection status. Standard precautions are based on the 
principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions and exc
retions, except sweat, regardless of 
whether they contain visible blood, non
-
intact skin and mucous membranes may contain 
transmissible infectious agents. Standard precautions include: respiratory hygiene/cough 
etiquette; hand hygiene before and after cari
ng for a patient; use of gloves (clean, non
-
sterile 
gloves are adequate); use of masks, eye protection, face shields and gowns (a clean, non
-
sterile 
gown is adequate) when splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions are 
possible; cle
aning of patient
-

linen; and precautions to reduce the possibility of health care worker exposure to bloodborne 
pathogens. Private rooms are generally not necessary but may be considered for pati
ents who 
contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene. Reusable dishes and 
eating utensils are washed and sanitized in a manner that renders them safe for reuse (e.g., in a 
dishwasher with recommended
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.
1
 
104
 
 
 
water temperature).
 
Linen and laundry are washed and dried according to routine standards and 
procedures.
 
 
Hand Hygiene
 
Hand hygiene is a general term that applies to any of the following: 1) handwashing with plain 
(non
-
antimicrobial) soap and water; 2) antiseptic handwash (
washing hands with water and soap 
containing an antiseptic agent); or 3) antiseptic hand rub (waterless antiseptic product, most 
often alcohol
-
based, rubbed on all surfaces of hands).  Hand hygiene is to be performed before 
and after contact with patients,
 
after contact with contaminated items and immediately after 
removing gloves. Hands are to be washed with soap and water when visibly dirty or soiled with 
blood or other body fluids, contaminated with proteinaceous material, exposed to spores (e.g., 
Bacill
us species or Clostridium difficile), suspected or proven, before eating and after using a 
restroom. It is essential health care personnel always perform hand hygiene between patient 
contacts and after removing personal protective equipment
 
(PPE).
 
Hand hyg
iene has frequently been cited as the single most important practice to reduce the 
transmission of infectious agents and is an essential element of standard precautions.
 
 
Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette
 
Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is a combinat
ion of measures designed to minimize the 
transmission of respiratory pathogens via droplet or airborne routes in health care settings. The 
components of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette are: 1) covering the mouth and nose when 
coughing or sneezing; 2) u
sing tissues to contain respiratory secretions with prompt disposal 
into the nearest waste receptacle after use; 3) performing hand hygiene (e.g., handwashing with 
non
-
antimicrobial soap and water, alcohol
-
based hand rub, or antiseptic handwash) after havi
ng 
contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects/materials; 4) offering a mask to 
persons who are coughing to decrease contamination of the surrounding environment; and 5) 
turning the head away from others and maintaining spatial separation,
 
ideally greater than 3 feet, 
when coughing. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette should be used with any person (e.g., 
patients and accompanying family members or friends) with signs of a cold or other respiratory 
infection (e.g., cough, congestion, rhinor
rhea and increased production of respiratory secretions) 
who enters any health care facility. Health care facilities should post visual alerts (in appropriate 
languages) at the entrance to outpatient treatment areas (e.g., emergency departments, physician 
offices, outpatient clinics) instructing patients and persons who accompany them (e.g., family, 
friends) to inform health care personnel of symptoms of a respiratory infection when they first 
register for care and to practice respiratory hygiene/cough etiq
uette. When space and chair 
availability permit, coughing persons should be encouraged to sit at least 3 feet away from 
others in common waiting areas.
 
 
Droplet Precautions
 
In addition to standard precautions, droplet precautions are intended to reduce the
 
risk of 
droplet transmission of infectious agents from close respiratory or mucous membrane contact 
(e.g., less than 3 feet) with large
-
particle respiratory droplets
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.

105
 
 
 
(larger than 5 µm in size). Respiratory droplets can be generated by the 
patient during coughing, 
sneezing, talking or the performance of cough
-
inducing procedures. Because droplets do not 
remain suspended in the air, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent 
droplet transmission; single
-
patient rooms are
 
preferred. Health care personnel and visitors wear 

be worn once, changed when moist and then discarded. Upon touching or discarding a used 
mask, hand hygiene i
s to be performed.  During procedures that may generate small particles of 
respiratory secretions (e.g., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, nebulizer treatment, 
suctioning), health care personnel should wear gloves, gown, face/eye protection, and a fit
-
tested 
N95 or other appropriate particulate respirator. When a single
-
patient room is not available, 
pandemic influenza patients may be cohorted (e.g., place the patient in a room with other 
patients who have active pandemic influenza infection but no oth
er infection) with spatial 
separation of patients (e.g., greater than 3 feet between beds in multi
-
patient rooms). In general, 
wearing eye protection (e.g., goggles) or a face shield for routine contact with pandemic 
influenza patients is not necessary, bu
t should be worn as recommended for standard 
precautions. If transport or movement of the patient from the room is necessary, the patient is to 
wear a surgical mask that covers the mouth and nose, if possible.
 
 
Contact Precautions
 
In addition to standard p
recautions, contact precautions are intended to reduce the risk of 
epidemiologically important microorganisms by direct (e.g., hand or skin
-
to
-
 
skin contact) or 
indirect (e.g., touching environmental surfaces or patient
-
care items) contact. Single
-
patient 
rooms are preferred and health care personnel and visitors wear gown and gloves for all 

should be worn only once and then placed in a waste or laundry receptacle, as
 
appropriate. If 
gowns are in short supply (i.e., the demand during a pandemic could exceed the supply), 
priorities for their use may need to be established. When a single
-
patient room is not available, 
pandemic influenza patients may be cohorted (e.g., pl
ace the patient in a room with other 
patients who have active pandemic influenza infection but no other infection) with spatial 
separation of patients (e.g., greater than 3 feet between beds in multi
-
patient rooms). When 
possible, dedicate the use of noncr
itical patient
-
care equipment to a single patient or cohort of 
patients to avoid sharing between patients. If use of common equipment or items is unavoidable, 
they must be adequately cleaned and disinfected before use for another patient. Rooms of 
patients
 
on contact precautions are given cleaning priority with a focus on frequent cleaning 
(e.g., at least daily) and disinfection of high touch surfaces (e.g., bed rails, bedside commodes, 
faucet handles, doorknobs, carts, charts) and equipment in the immediat
e vicinity of the patient.
 
 
Airborne Precautions

Also known as Airborne Infection Isolation [AII] Precautions.
 
 Illinois Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan 
March 2020
 
Version 5.

106
 
 
 
In addition to standard precautions, airborne precautions are used for the care of 
patients known 
or suspected to be infected with pathogens transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei (small
-
particle 
residue [5 µm or smaller in size] of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain 
suspended in the air and can be dispersed widely
 
by air currents within a room or over a long 
distance). Use of an airborne infection isolation (AII) room with the door closed is required to 
prevent airborne transmission. An AII room is a single
-
patient room equipped with special air 
handling and ventil
ation capacity (e.g., negative air pressure) that meet the American Institute of 
Architects/Facility Guidelines Institute (AIA/FGI) standards for AII rooms.
 
Respiratory protection (e.g., NIOSH
-
approved N95 or higher respirators) is worn by 
susceptible pers
ons when entering the room. Respirators should be used within the context of 
a respiratory protection program that includes fit
-
testing, medical clearance and training. If 
transport or movement of the patient from the room is necessary, the patient is to w
ear a 
surgical mask that covers the mouth and nose, if possible.
 
In the event of an outbreak or exposure where large numbers of patients require Airborne 
Precautions, consult IDPH Division of Infectious Diseases to determine the safety of 
cohorting patient
s together based on clinical diagnosis in areas with the lowest risk of 
airborne transmission.
 
 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
 
Personal protective equipment is a variety of barriers used alone or in combination to protect 
mucous membranes, skin, and c
lothing from contact with infectious agents.
 
PPE includes gloves, masks, respirators, goggles, face shields and gowns. Respirators (e.g., 
N95 or other appropriate particulate respirator) should be used within the context of a 
respiratory protection program
 
that includes fit
-
testing, medical clearance and training.

 Vaccination Plan
  of Health
    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 Providing a safe and effective 
COVID
-19 vaccine to all Hoosiers is a critical component of the State of 
Indiana™s strategy to reduce the spread of COVID
-19 and related illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths
 through
 appropriate allocat
ion
 and administr
ation
 of COVID
-19 vaccine to all Ho
osiers in a safe, timely and 
effective manner.  The following document serves as an interim draft plan for the Indiana Department of 
Health (IDOH), local public health programs, and public health partners on how to plan and operationalize a 
vaccination res
ponse to COVID
-19 within Indiana. 
 Indiana has established multi
-agency cross
-disciplinary advisory groups to enhance the development of 
plans, 
activity reach
, and risk/crisis response messaging and delivery:
 Vaccine Allocation Plan Development Advisory Gr
oup:
 Provided final recommendations on the ethical and 
equitable allocation of a limited COV
ID-19 vaccine. This group remains available to assemble as adjustments 
to the plan are needed based on the final allocation total and the safety and efficacy of the
 vaccine(s). 
 Ethical Considerations Advisory Group: 
Reviewed existing documents and assisted in writing and reviewing 
ethical approaches to vaccine allocation.
  This group founded their recommendations with the goals to 
decrease overall mortality, mitigat
e spread
, steward scarce resources responsibly, ensure feasibility of 
implementation, reinforce and support health care infrastructure necessary to treatment of disease, protect 
vulnerable populations, and promote fairness.
 Vaccine Review Advisory 
Group:
 This group will investigate available information on each COVID
-19 vaccine 
and will specifically review the safety profile and efficacy of each population of interest (those at clinical risk 

and demographic factors)
. Equitable 
Distribution and Communication Advisory Group:
 Worked to ensure that all Hoosiers were 
considered and represented as a component of the vaccine allocation plan. Advised on key components 
of 
communication.
 Data Advisory Group:
 Explored creative data resourc
es and compiled Indiana
-specific data for critical 
populations.  
 Vaccination Program Implementation Committee:
 External committee facilitated by the Indiana 
Department of Health™s 
(IDOH) 
State Health Commissioner with representation from state and local 
government organizations, private sectors, tribes, healthcare, education, and critical infrastructure.
 For Phase 1, Indiana will reinforce and support the healthcare workforce and those who are at the most risk 
of morbidity and mortality.  In the scenario t
hat Indiana does not receive sufficient vaccine to vaccinate all 
included in the population of focus, the IDOH has developed a per
-county percentage
-based metric to 
ensure equitable and equal distribution across Indiana. 
 Phase 1
-A: Guiding objective: Rein
force and support healthcare infrastructure & treatment of disease.
  This group includes all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential 
for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious material.
  Healthcare setting
s include, but are not limited to: hospitals, long
-term care facilities, outpatient 
facilities, home health care settings, pharmacies, dialysis centers, emergency medical services, 
frontline public health interventions, and COVID
-19 diagnostic and immuniza
tion teams.
   Indiana COVID
-19 Introduction 
iii
 Indiana 
Department
 Vaccination Plan
  of Health
    Phase 1
-B: Guiding objective:  Protect the vulnerable.
  Individuals who are at particular risk of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID
-19 disease 
based on the latest evidence
-based criteria. 
 Phase 2
: Guiding objective: Mitigate spread.
   Individuals who are
 at elevated risk of transmission of the disease because of working or living 
circumstances.  This includes persons living in correctional facilities, group homes or shelters, and 
individuals 
who™s
 in-person work is essential, required
, and places them in settings where social 
distancing is not possible and transmission risk is high.
 Phase 3
: Guiding objective: General public vaccination. 
 Phase 1
-A will utilize hospitals that are prepared to administer vaccine to all healthcare personn
el.  
Indiana 
hospitals
 were
 surveyed regarding their readiness to provide vaccine to healthcare personnel, including 
those not associated with their facility.  
Phases 1
-B and 
2 will 
expand to 
utiliz
e local health departments 
(LHDs) and partnerships with co
mmercial pharmacies.
 IDOH has provided a
 COVID
-19 Vaccine Planning 
Template 
to the 94 LHDs and
 will review each of the plans prior to vaccine delivery to ensure adequate and 
appropriate vaccination efforts are addressed locally.
  Th
e continuous quality imp
rovement at the local level 
ensures state and local readiness of dispensing of mass prophylaxis, including vaccines, to Hoosiers across 

the state.
 IDOH will further augment the local response by deployment of vaccination strike teams embedded in our 10 

dis
trict mobile response units throughout the State to administer vaccine to those 
who
 are not covered by 
traditional vaccine providers and/or local public health efforts. 
Indiana
 is also piloting a vaccination 
partnership with our EMS and paramedicine providers and plans
 to incorporate them in COVID
-19 vaccination 
in communities 
statewide
. The
 Indiana National Guard, an important part of our testing program, will also be 
engaged w
ith our phase 2 and 3 mass immunization plan. 
 To facilitate early vaccination efforts and to ensure proper provider coverage 
statewide
, the IDOH has 
developed a web
-based/on
-line COVID
-19 Provider
 Enrollment form capturing all 
required datasets as 
include
d in the ﬁCDC COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreementﬂ. This web
-based system will be 
used to collect required data 
that
 will be transmitted electronically to federal systems
, therefore enrolling 
Indiana providers as COVID
-19 Vaccine Providers. The
 IDOH
 will use Tiberius as a visualization tool for 
allocations, vaccine administration data monitoring
, and transparency. 
 Currently,
 743 providers enrolled in the Indiana Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program are actively vaccinating 
and recording vaccinat
ion administration data in the Children and Hoosier Immunization Registry Program 
(CHIRP)
, Indiana™s immunization information system.
 There are 1,923 other facilities 
that
 have established a bi
-directional interface with CHIRP.  IDOH is working with a thir
d-party registration vendor to identify a 
registration platform that will link to CHIRP. Registered COVID
-19 vaccination providers will order COVID
-19 
vaccine through CHIRP. IDOH will utilize existing procedures routinely used for ordering publicly funded 
vaccines. 
 A robust and nimble communication plan will be the foundation of successful COVID
-19 vaccine 
administration and uptake. The focus must be on ensuring consumer trust by providing information that is 

timely, accurate and appropriate. Messages will
 be crafted specific
ally
 to each audience and distributed 
through the most effective channels to achieve the maximum response.

   I.
 COVID
-19 VACCINATION PREPAREDNESS PLANNING 
 Pandemic vaccination response planning requires collaboration among a wide range of public
- and private
-sector partners, including immunization and public health emergency 
preparedness programs, emergency management agencies, healthcare organizations, indu
stry 
groups that include critical infrastructure sectors, policy makers, and community vaccination 
providers (e.g., pharmacies, occupational health settings, doctors™ offices). Many of these 
partners are engaged regularly in seasonal influenza and other ou
tbreak vaccination 
campaigns, and many 
have 
served 
in past vaccination response campaigns.
   A. State Improvement Planning 
 Improvement planning is the identification of strengths, areas of improvements, and 
corrective actions that result from workshops, exer
cises, or real
-world events. The Indiana 
Department of Health (IDOH) has identified 
streng
ths and 
gaps
 in program planning during 
exercises and real
-world events. Below are lessons learned from two real
-world events that 
have affected the state of Indiana,
 the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic and 2018 hepatitis A outbreak
. 1. 2009 H1N1 Pa
ndemic 
 Following the statewide response to the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic within Indiana, specific 
strengths and areas of improvement were documented in Indiana™s 
After
-Action
 Review 
(AAR). A comp
rehensive overview of Indiana™s actions, strengths, and areas of 
improvements can be found in the full H1N1 AAR document. Below are highlights from 
the AAR regard
ing 
vaccine administration, documentation, and messaging. These quality 
improvement actions ha
ve been incorporated into routine vaccinations and current 
COVID
-19 vaccine implementation efforts.
 Strengths Identified
:   Collaboration with corporations and universities to offer vaccines 
  Weekly conference call communications between local health depart
ments (LHDs) 
and IDOH 
  Development of targeted priority groups 
  Provider agreement and CHIRP forms 
  IDOH
 training sessions on vaccines, injections, and administration for volunteers 
  Higher
 uptake among special populations when vaccine was directly provided within 
the community 
 Areas of Improvement Identified
:   Timeliness and initial amount of vaccine was 
much
 lower than expected and 
subsequent issues getting vaccine early. If there is a delay or change, inform early, 
often, and why 
  Provide a standardized interpretation and messaging of priority populations within all 
counties 
  Development of centralized co
mmunications and identification of vaccine subject 
matter expert (SME)/spokesperson within Indiana 
    Indiana COVID
-19 2  Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
    Ensure all providers receive the vaccine information statement (VIS) on time 
  Communicate accurate and timely information to counteract vaccine hesitancy. L
ow 
interest in vaccine from general public, providers, and healthcare workers initially
  Vaccine hesitancy due to myths and false statements on the internet. 
  Provide training on proper use of ancillary supplies (i.e., syringes, needles)
 2. 2018 Hepatitis A Ou
tbreak 
 The IDOH responded to 
statewide hepatitis
 A outbreak
 starting in 2017
 associated with 
a national outbreak by activating an 
Incident Command S
ystem (
ICS
). This response 
identified a great number of modifications that needed to be made to effectively
 deploy 
vaccination strike teams
, including:
   Always have a state employee as part of the team so that state
-rented vehicles can 
be utilized 
  Establish a standard operating procedure for offsite vaccination clinics 
  Establish a standard operating procedure for using the mass vaccination module in 
the state immunization information system 
  Establish a pool of vaccinators 
who
 are willing to go int
o jails, homeless shelters, and 
high
-risk areas 
 These modifications enabled IDOH to deploy strike teams for COVID
-19 testing in long 
term care facilities within 24 hours
. B. Local Improvement Planning 
 Local health departments (LHDs) frequently engage local partners in exercising Points of 

Dispensing (POD) operations and planning scenarios. This continuous quality improvement 
at the local level ensures state and local readiness of dispensing of mass prop
hylaxis, 
including vaccines, to Hoosiers across the state. This periodic review and revision of local 

plans is integral to the improvement process. Continuous quality improvement is ongoing as 
LHDs move through the 
various 
phases of workshops, tabletops, f
unctional exercises, and 
real
-world activities.
  Local 
improvement 
planning is further bolstered by 
the 
annual
 Public 
Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) 
program 
cooperative agreement
. The PHEP 
cooperative agreement
 provides
 funding 
assistance
 while setti
ng annual requirements that 
help
 health departments build and strengthen their abilities to effectively respond to a 
range of public health threats, including infectious diseases, natural disasters, and 
biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological event
s. Preparedness activities funded by the 
PHEP cooperative agreement specifically target the development of emergency
-ready 
public health 
response plans

Incident Support Model (ISM) 
Organizational 
Structure 
 The ISM is a variation of 
a traditional Incident Command System (
ICS
) structure that 
separates the information management/situational awareness function from the ICS 
Planning Section and combines the functions of the ICS Operations and Logistics Sections 

from the ICS Administration/Finance Section. The DOC ISM structure typ
ically focus
es exclusively on support functions rather than operations.
  With the

, the
 current
 IDOH 
ISM incorporates both 
situational 
awareness/
support functions and 
operational
 elements.
 As with the ICS
, the director of a 
DOC 
ISM is supported by personnel designated to key 
functions, subject matter experts, and technical specialists. Staff supporting the Response 
Manager include a 
Public Information Officer
 and legal advisor. The General Staff sections 
consist of Situational Awareness, Planning Support, Resources Support, and

 The IDOH
 has established an internal vaccine planning group and working group. The 
purpose of the working group is to 
develop the state™s COVID
-19 vaccine plan and 
operationalize functions referenced within the plan. This group is comprised of multiple 
representatives from various divisions within the agency. These representatives are noted in 
the agency™s ICS organizatio
n chart above. The internal vaccine planning group is 
comprised of working group members in addition to policy level executives. High level 
strategies, policies, tasking, and planning assumptions originate within the internal vaccine 

planning group. These 
strategies are then operationalized and developed within the 
working group.

   C. Vaccination Program Implementation Committee (External) 
 Reaching intended vaccine recipients is essential to achieving desired levels of COVID
-19 
vaccination coverage. To ensure equitable access to vaccinations, information about 
populations within a jurisdiction and the logistical requirements for providing th
em access 
to COVID
-19 vaccination services requires collaboration with external entities and 
community partners who are familiar with how they obtain healthcare and other essential 
services. 
 Indiana has established an external vaccination program implemen
tation committee 
facilitated by the State Health Commissioner. The purpose of this external implementation 

committee is to enhance the development of plans, reach of activities, and messaging and 
delivery related to the COVID
-19 vaccine. This goal of this 
external committee is to provide 
coordination and communication between state and local governments, private sectors, 
tribes, healthcare, education, and critical infrastructure.

(ISMA), Indiana Hospital Association (IHA), Indiana Pr
ofessional Licensing Agency (PLA), 
Regenstrief Institute, Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH), and two health 

systems (Indiana University Health and Ascension St. Vincent). 
 E. Partnership 
 To implement an effective, equitable, and representative COVID
-19 vaccine strategy
, IDOH 
has leveraged existing partnerships within the agency, state and local governments, 

healthcare, minority groups, private industry, and higher education. These partners are 
represented within the internal and external implementation
 committees and advisory 
groups listed above.
 F. Multi
-Agency Coordination 
 The evolution of the size and complexity of hazards and threats has demonstrated the need 
for effective planning and coordinated emergency response. These events also show 
disasters h
ave no geographical, economic
, or social boundaries and involve multiple 
jurisdictions, agencies
, and organizations. 
To effectively manage efforts of a multi
-agency 
coordination system, the State of Indiana has adapted its planning and response capability 

based upon the following operational constructs: 
 1. State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) 
 The Indiana State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) is the I
ndiana Department of 
Homeland Security
-managed physical location where multi
-agency coordination 
occurs
. The purpose of the SEOC is to provide a central coordination hub for the support 
of local, district, and state needs. The SEOC can be configured to expand or contract as 

necessary to respond to different levels of incidents requiring state assistance.
 The SEOC is staffed and organized with the Emergency Support Function (ESF) concept 
incorporated into an Incident Command System (ICS) structure. Agencies that represent 
ESF positions are activated in the SEOC during an incident to execute the response 
phase
 of emergency management. The designated primary and support agencies for 
the ESF positions in the SEOC can be arranged and tasked as needed by the IDHS 
Response Division Director of Operations. The elevated activation level is determined by 

the pandemic a
nd the need for coordination and resource support. The ESF primary 
agencies remain responsible for the coordination of all phases of emergency 

management as outlined in their respective ESF annexes, regardless of their SEOC 

staffing assignments. 
     Indiana COVID
-19 8  Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   2. Executiv
e Policy Group 
 Emergencies and disasters can produce issues requiring prompt decisions to serve 
short and long
-term emergency management needs. The Executive Policy Group is a 
function of 
Indiana Department of Homeland Security (
IDHS
) that 
is 
established to 
address issue
s concerning the safety and welfare of Indiana residents, 
property,
 and the 
environment. 
 The Executive Policy Group 
has been
 activated to advise the Governor, local officials 
and the public and recommend protective actions to be taken 
during an 

emergency/
event. 
The Executive Policy Group 
has
 assembled
 in the SEOC to assist in 
coordination and decision making. 
 The Executive Policy Group consists of stakeholders with the authority to make policy
-related decisions or make suggestions to support the state™s r
esponse and technical 
evaluation during an incident but varies depending upon the type, size and complexity 
of the incident. The IDHS Executive Director o
r designee 
serves
 as chairperson of the 
Executive Policy Group. The Executive Policy group consist
s of lead agency 
representatives from relevant ESFs as well as subject matter experts as necessary. 
 3. Indiana Districts 
 The State of Indiana, in conjunction with multiple agencies, has created Homeland 

Security and Public Health Preparedness Districts. 
The 
district organization and planning 
concept is comprised of multiple jurisdictions, disciplines, and agencies. Together they 

focus on common strategic goals and objectives to 
satisfy and meet national, state, and local homeland 
security and public safety ne
eds. By coming 
together, many counties, local governments
, and 
the State benefit from sharing resources, 
eliminating redundancy in critical response 
activities and coordinating emergency planning, 

training, and exercise activities. 
 While each District 
var
ies in infrastructure, organization, hazards, and 
other facets, several commonalities of Districts 
include: District Planning Councils, Healthcare 
Coalitions, Indiana District Response Task Forces, 

and other elements.
 G. Tribal Engagement 
 The Pokagon Band of Potowatomi Native Americans is 

located in southwestern Michigan and northeastern 
Indiana. 
To engage the Pokagon Band within the 
State 
of Indiana, the IDOH is coordinating with the 
State of 
Michigan, triba
l representatives, and the St. Joseph 
County Health Department. The Centers for 
Figure 1: Indian
a Health Preparedness Districts
    Indiana COVID
-19 9  Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working directly with the Indian Health Service (
IHS) 
to provide vaccination services to the populations they serve.  
 IDOH
 coordination
 with the 
State of Michigan is crucial 
since
 most
 community members 
within the Pokagon Band seek health services through IHS locations in Michigan. The IDOH 
and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) have a unified and 
coordinated approac
h to providing access to the COVID
-19 vaccine to the Pokagon Band. 
Through joint coordination with MDHHS
, it has been determined that 
10% of the overall 

vaccine allocated to the Pokagon Band will be 
allocated to the State of Indiana to support 
tribal vacci
nation efforts. 
Another key partner engaged in the coordination is the St. Joseph 
County Health Department
, which
 has strong existing ties and communication with the 
Pokagon Band.  
 Finally, representatives from the Pokagon Band are represented on the IDOH
 State Health 
Commissioner™s External COVID
-19 Vaccine Implementation Committee. Representatives 
include the Native American Indian Commission 
Œ Health Committee, the Native American 
Indian Commission, and Pokagon Band of Potowatomi Native Americans 
Œ St. 
Joseph 
County.  
 H. Critical Population Partners 
 The IDOH has engaged multiple key partners for critical populations through its five 
advisory groups and external vaccine implementation committee. These groups represent 
the critical populations within commun
ities across Indiana. These partners understand that 
populations they serve and 
represent
 and
 are
 essential in messaging and communicating 
about the COVID
-19 vaccine. In the early phases of vaccine planning these partners are 
important in data gathering of critical population estimates and developing strategies for 

engagement and outreach.

 PHASED APPROACH TO 
COVID
-19 VACCINATION 
 Due to changing vaccine supply levels at various points during the COVID
-19 Vaccination 
Program, planning needs to be flexible but as specific as possible to accommodate a variety 
of scenarios. A key point to consider is that vaccine 
supply will be limited at the beginning of 
the program, so the allocation of doses must focus on vaccination providers and settings for 

vaccination of limited critical populations as well as outreach to these populations. The 
vaccine supply is projected to
 increase quickly over the proceeding months, allowing 
vaccination efforts to be expanded to additional critical populations and the general public. It 

is important to note that recommendations on the various population groups to receive initial 
doses of v
accine could change after vaccine is available, depending on each vaccine™s 
characteristics, vaccine supply, disease epidemiology, and local community factors.
 The goal 
was to make
 the plan simple, direct, clear, and actionable so that it is easy to 
interp
ret and implement. Keeping it simple, makes it more feasible that more people can be 
vaccinated
 quickly and in an orderly fashion.
  Various workgroups reviewed national and 
other guidance while considering any special considerations or circumstances specif
ic to the 
Hoosier State.
  A phased approach, based on an ethical and equitable distribution schema, is 
necessary since not enough vaccine 
will be 
released initially to vaccinate everyone and also
 provides guidance as more vaccine becomes available.
 A large, multidisciplinary group of statewide experts was assembled to help create, give 

input,
 and feedback, and finalize the plan. In an effort to build trust and lend credibility, ID
OH had the fores
ight to engage this large, diverse group of local experts to assure Hoosiers that 
precious vaccine resources will be utilized in an efficient and equitable manner.

 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   A. Phase 1: Potentially Limited Supply of COV
ID-19 Vaccine Doses Available 
 In the initial phase, Phase 1, initial doses of vaccine will likely be distributed in a limited 
manner with the goal of maximizing vaccine acceptance and public health protection while 
minimizing waste and inefficiency. 
 Key 
characteristics of Phase 1:
:  COVID
-19 vaccine supply may be limited
  COVID
-19 vaccine administration efforts must concentrate on the initial populations of 
focus to achieve vaccination coverage in those groups
  Inventory, distribution, and any repositioning 
of vaccine will be closely monitored 

through reporting to ensure end
-to-end visibility of vaccine doses
 Indiana is concentrating early COVID
-19 vaccine administration efforts on the initial critical 
populations identified in 
Section 
IV: Critical Population
s. The administration of these 
COVID
-19 vaccination services will be in point
-of-dispensing (POD) settings. This allows for 
the maximum number of people to be vaccinated while maintaining social distancing and 
other infection control procedures. 
 Indiana i
s prioritizing enrollment activities for vaccination providers and settings who will 
administer COVID
-19 vaccine to the 
Phase 1 
populations of focus. IDOH is developing 
operational procedures 
to establish
 mobile clinics to provide vaccine to individuals wh
o live 
in remote, rural areas, and areas with vaccination services deficiencies. While performing 
Phase 1 activities, IDOH will continue preparing for Phase 2. This includes recruiting 
additional vaccinators to staff PODs, contract needs for vaccination se
rvices, and review of 
state practice acts to allow for expanded professional practice, if needed.
 B. Phase 2: Large Number of Vaccine Doses Available 
 As the supply of available vaccine increases, distribution will expand, increasing access to 
vaccination ser
vices for a larger population. As these larger quantities become available, 
IDOH will continue to ensure these two objectives are achieved
:  providing
 equitable access 
to COVID
-19 vaccination for all critical populations to achieve high COVID
-19 vaccinatio
n coverage 
and 
ensur
ing
 high uptake in specific populations, particularly in groups that are at 
a higher risk for severe outcomes from COVID
-19.
 Key
 characteristics of Phase 2
:  COVID
-19 vaccine supply will likely be sufficient to meet demand for critical populations 
as well as the general public.
  Additional COVID
-19 vaccine doses available will permit an increase in vaccination 
providers and locations.
  A surge in COVID
-19 vaccine
 demand is possible, so a broad vaccine administration 
network for surge capacity will be necessary.
  Low COVID
-19 vaccine is also a possibility, so Indiana will monitor supply and adjust our 
strategy to minimize vaccine wastage.
    Indiana COVID
-19 13  Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   In anticipation of an incre
ase in COVID
-19 vaccine supply levels during Phase 2, IDOH will 
adapt 
strategies for 
administration location, vaccine provider
s, and access to account for 
this increased availability. Vaccination efforts will expand beyond the initial population 
group 
outlined in Phase 1. IDOH will ensure equitable access for all populations. The COVID
-19 vaccine will be administered through additional types of vaccination sites, including, 
commercial and private sector partners (pharmacies, doctors™ officers, clinics),
 and public 
health sites (mobile clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers [FQHCs], rural health clinics, 

public health clinics, and temporary off
-site clinics).
 C. Phase 3: Sufficient Supply of Vaccine Doses for Entire Pop
ulation (Surplus of 
Doses) 
 Ultima
tely, COVID
-19 vaccine will be widely available and integrated into routine 
vaccination programs, operated by both public and private partners.
 Key characteristics of Phase 3:
  Likely sufficient COVID
-19 vaccine supply where supply might exceed demand
  Broad
 vaccine administration network for increased access
  Increased emphasis on redistribution of 
existing vaccine
 During Phase 3, IDOH will continue to focus on equitable vaccination access to vaccination 
services. COVID
-19 vaccine uptake and coverage in criti
cal populations will continually be 
monitored. IDOH will intervene and develop enhanced strategies to reach populations with 
low vaccination uptake or coverage, if observed. The development of partnerships with 
commercial and private entities will be utili
zed to ensure COVID
-19 vaccine and vaccination 
services are widely available to Hoosiers. Vaccine wastage will continually be minimized 

through the monitoring of vaccine supplies and the repositioning of refrigerated vaccine 
products.

 CRITICAL POPULATION
S  The IDOH is working with external partners within the five COVID
-19 Vaccine Advisory Groups 
to determine populations of focus for COVID
-19 vaccination and ensure equity in access to 
COVID
-19 vaccination across the state of Indiana. A key goal is to dete
rmine critical 
populations for COVID
-19 vaccination, including those groups identified to receive the first 
available doses of COVID
-19 vaccine when supply is expected to be limited. 
 After a short period of potentially limited vaccine supply, supply will 
increase quickly, 
allowing vaccination efforts to be expanded to include additional critical populations as well 

as the general public. Indiana is developing strategies to ensure equitable access to 
vaccination for each of the critical populations identifi
ed below.
 A. Identifying and Estimating Critical Populations 
 IDOH is working with external partners within the External Vaccination Program 
Implementation Committee and 
the 
five COVID
-19 Vaccine Advisory Groups to identify, 
collect, and compile critical population estimate
s. Indiana Professional Licensing Agency 
(PL
A), U.S. Census, and industry
 data was used 
to determine the 
population estimates per 
critical population. 
In the future, a
nother
 available option to collect this information i
s creating
 a uniform electronic template utilizing REDCap to collect critical po
pulation census 
data from partners and stakeholders engaged in the Vaccination Implementation 
Committee (External) and various Advisory Committees (External).
 B. Estimates of Critical Populations and Critical Infrastructure Workforce 
 The I
DOH
 COVID
-19 Vaccin
e Allocation Committee prioritized the healthcare workforce 
and 
those people who are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality 
for Phase 1 of COVID
-19 
vaccine distribution. Therefore, the Data Gathering Work Group focused on th
ose 
population
s. Estimates o
f the identified critical populations and critical infrastructure workforce are 
based on accurate information from population representative organizations, industry 
leaders, and public open
-source data. IDOH will also leverage the federal HHS data 
manageme
nt system, Tiberius. These accurate estimates are leveraged to minimize 
potential waste of vaccine, constituent products, and ancillary supplies.

 This group includes all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who 
have 
the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials
 and
 individuals who are at particular risk of mortality and morbidity associated with COVID
-19 disease
. Group 
1-A:  All paid and unpaid healthcare personnel with the potential for direct or 
indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials.  Healthcare settings include, but are 
not limited to: hospitals, long
-term care facilitates such as assisted living or skilled 
nursing facilities, outpatient facilities, home health care settings, pharmacies, 
dialysis 
centers, 
emergency medical services, frontline public health interventions, and COVID

This includes people 65 years and older, people with 
co-morbid conditions that place them at higher ri
sk for morbidity or mortality from COVID

, and residents of long
-term care facilities. 
As more information becomes 
known regarding the disease and its response to vaccination, some of these individuals 
may not be appropriate for vaccination b
ecause it is anticipated they will have 
inadequate immune response to the vaccination and/or they are at increased risk of 
complication secondary to the vaccination itself.

 Furthermore, some groups may be excluded because of the parameters for both 

emergency use authorization (EUA) and their exclusion from clinical trials, and therefore 
use has not been 
approved for them.  Public health officials in consultation with COVID
-19 clinical and scientific experts should arrive at the final list of eligible inclusion criteria. 

Prioritizing those who are most vulnerable promotes utility and stewardship, and it is
 a 
critical tool for serving the goals of equity and fairness, particularly as existing data 

continue to show a disproportionate burden of the pandemic on some populations.

   The CDC Social Vulnerability Index will be reviewed during the allocation process and 
applied if there is a limited vaccine during this phase.  A document that identifies the SVI 
and estimated counts for comorbid conditions per county will assist in target
ed 
allocation, distribution, and communication during this phase. Counties with higher SVIs 
may receive an increased allocation per population.

 3. Phase
 3: General Public Vaccination 
 D. Sub
-Prioritization of Critical Populations 
 In the scenario that Indiana does not receive sufficient vaccine to vaccinate all included in 
the initial populations of focus, Indiana has identified the following subset groups (Ph
ase 1
-A and 1
-B). These two phases will determine who will receive the first available doses of 
COVID
-19 vaccine.  
Additionally, t
his is 
a 
general framework and guidance. Hospitals, care 
delivery sites, and jurisdictions have autonomy to implement these gu
idelines in the way 
that make the most sense to their specific populations and community.
  If 
the state vaccine 
allocation
 is limited so that there is insufficient supply to vaccinate healthcare personnel
 who are willing to receive the vaccine in phase 1a,
 additional 
parameters could be applied.  
This includes but is not limited to allocating the vaccine to healthcare personnel at higher 
risk to exposure to the vaccine
 or higher risk of morbidity or mor
tality
.   The process for determining subsets of critic
al populations for vaccination is based on the 
classification of risk (low to very high based on position within an organization) for exposure 
to SARS
-CoV
-2. The U.S. Department of Labor™s Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) identifies and
 classifies risk of worker exposure to SARS
-CoV
-2. 
Below are examples of occupational risk classification. Additional information can be found 
here

   Occupational SARS
-CoV
-2 Hazard Recognition Categorization 
 Lower Exposure Risk (Caution) 
 Jobs
 that do not require contact with people 
known to be, or suspected of being, infected 
with SARS
-CoV
-2. Workers in this category 
have minimal occupational contact with the 
public and other coworkers. Examples 
include: 
  Remote workers (i.e., those working fr
om 
home during the pandemic). 
  Office workers who do not have frequent 
close contact with coworkers, customers, or the 
public. 
  Manufacturing and industrial facility workers who do not have frequent close contact 
with coworkers, customers, or the public. 
  Healthcare workers providing on
ly telemedicine services. 
  Long
-distance truck drivers. 
 Medium Exposure Risk 
 Jobs that require frequent/close contact with people who may be infected, but who are not 

known to have or suspected of having COVID
-19. Workers in this category include: 
  Those
 who may have frequent contact with travelers who return from international 
locations with widespread COVID
-19 transmission. 
  Those who may have contact with the general public (e.g., in schools, high population 

density work environments, and some high
-vol
ume retail settings). 
 High Exposure Risk 
 Jobs with a high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of SARS
-CoV
-2. 
Workers in this category include: 
  Healthcare delivery and support staff (hospital staff who must enter patients™ rooms) 
exposed
 to known or suspected COVID
-19 patients. 
  Medical transport workers (ambulance vehicle operators) moving known or suspected 

COVID
-19 patients in enclosed vehicles. 
  Mortuary workers involved in preparing bodies for burial or cremation of people known 

to h
ave, or suspected of having, COVID
-19 at the time of death. 
 Very High Exposure Risk 
 Jobs with a very high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of SARS
-CoV
-2 during specific medical, postmortem, or laboratory procedures. Workers in this ca
tegory 
include: 
 Figure 3: Occupational hazard 
recognition categories
   Indiana COVID

 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
    Healthcare workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, dentists, paramedics, emergency medical 
technicians) performing aerosol
-generating procedures (e.g., intubation, cough induction 
procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams, or invasive specimen 
collection) on known or suspected COVID
-19 patients. 
  Healthcare or laboratory personnel collecting or handling specimens from known or 

suspected COVID
-19 patients (e.g., manipulating cultures from known or suspected 
COVID
-19 patients). 
  Morgue workers perf
orming autopsies, which generally involve aerosol
-generating 
procedures, on the bodies of people who are known to have, or are suspected of having, 

COVID
-19 at the time of their death.
 E. Triggers to Move Between Phases
 In the case there is limited uptake of 
the vaccine, IDOH is prepared expand within a phase or 

to other phases as needed.  This may occur at the state or local level as determined by the 

feasibility of redistribution.  
The success is predicated on the willingness of local 
communities to do work 
in advance: communicate their plan, identify individuals from each 
phase that will receive the vaccine so that communities and organizations are ready when 
the vaccine is released.
 Potential triggers that have been discussed to broaden the 
allocated group 
include
:  1. Identifying 
what percent
 of 
a 
target population 
being 
vaccinated 
would indicate 
saturation of that 
target group, 
 2. Prioritizing 
efficiency 
and 
minimiz
ing
 waste (stewardship)
 by expanding 
in situations 
where the vaccine administration is limited by expiration times. 
 3. Utilizing a system of preregistration to identify that the targeted group has received the 
vaccine and then opening up the vaccine to further groups or subsets.
 4.
 Pivot to new gr
oup based on safety/efficacy data on particular 
groups
 as 
information 
becomes available. 
 F. Describing, Locating, and Communicating with Critical Populations 
 To improve vaccination among critical population groups, Indiana must ensure these 
groups have acce
ss to vaccination services. To inform COVID
-19 vaccination outreach 
efforts, Indiana has created a visual map of these populations, including places of 

employment for the critical infrastructure workforce category, to assist in COVID
-19 
vaccination clinic 
planning, especially for satellite, temporary or off
-site clinics. Indiana is 
also utilizing the HHS data management and mapping tool
, Tiberius
, to estimate 
populations and to map providers and populations. 
 The next step is 
developing
 and send
ing
 key mess
ages 
regarding
 vaccination logistics for 
these critical populations and critical infrastructure groups. This outreach
 will 
include both 
promotional and educational information so the critical populations know where they can 
get vaccinated and why they shou
ld get vaccinated. 
   Indiana COVID
-19 22 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   IDOH is establishing points of contact (POCs) for each organization, 
employer,
 or community 
(as appropriate) within the critical population groups. 
Additionally, 
critical 
populations 
identified in Phase 
1A have 
completed a R
EDCap
 survey t
o ensure re
adiness of vaccine 
allocation. 
Partnerships with trusted community organizations can facilitate early agreement 
on communication channels and methods for rapidly disseminating information and 
ultimately ensuring these groups have access
 to vaccination. These organizations include 
the faith
-based, community regional health workers and healthcare clinics and coalitions, 
racial and ethnic organizations, and others across the state as informed by the data and 
map. Many of these groups and pa
rtner organizations are outlined in Section 2G of this plan.

   V. COVID
-19 PROVIDER RECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT 
 An adequate network of trained, technically competent COVID
-19 vaccination providers in 
accessible settings is critical to Indiana™s COVID
-19 vaccin
ation program success. For this 
reason, 
the
 IDOH is conducting provider recruitment and enrollment in advance of COVID
-19 
vaccine availability. Early planning efforts are focused on engaging those vaccination providers 
and services that can rapidly vaccina
te initial populations of focus (see Section 4: Critical 
Populations) as soon as a COVID
-19 vaccine is available (Phase 1). Subsequent planning 
includes recruiting and enrolling providers to vaccinate additional critical populations and 
eventually the gene
ral population when sufficient vaccine supply is available (Phases 2 and 3).
 A. Provider Enrollment Efforts 
 The 
IDOH 
has developed a web
-based COVID
-19 Provider Enrollment form capturing all 
inf
ormation
 defined in the ﬁCDC COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Provid
er Agreementﬂ
 form
. This web
-based system will be used to enroll Indiana providers.
 Figure
s 3 and
 Figure
 4 depict 
screenshots of the IDOH COVID
-19 Vaccine Provider Enrollment Portal.
  The web
-based app will allow for providers to submit, retrieve, and downl
oad their 
submitted information in PDF format.  
  The application will have fields that will collect info from providers pertinent to various 

phases of vaccine availability to patients  
  The application will verify provider license numbers with the Indiana Professional 
Licensing Agency 
(PLA
) database and will allow only valid and active licensed providers 
to be entered. 
 The 
IDOH
 will work with professional organizations such as the Indian
a Hospital Association 
and the Indiana Pharmacy Alliance to recruit members of their organizations as vaccination 
partners.  Many of these healthcare providers are already enrolled in either the Indiana 
Immunization Information System or the Indiana Vaccin
es for Children (VFC) Program.   
 The information collected within the provider enrollment portal is electronically transferred 
to the IDOH Children and Hoosier Immunization Registry Program (CHIRP)
, Indiana™s
 immunization information system (IIS) 
vaccine registry

doses.  This population has been identified based on the guidance 
from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Vaccine Allocation Plan Development 
Advisory Group hosted by the 
IDOH
 Chief Medical Officer.   
   Indiana COVID
-19 25 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   The providers identified for Phase 1A will be vaccinated using a hub and spoke model.  
Vaccine
 will be sent to large hospitals in central locations and identified populations will be 
invited to receive vaccinations at that location
 (open POD model, when appropriate)
.  Individuals 
who
 received the vaccine as part of Phase 1A will return to the same 
location 
at 
the appropriate time interval 
to receive a second dose.  An appointment for the second 

dose will be made prior to the healthcare professional leaving the site after receiving the 
first dose.  Since this is a small segment of the population, ind
ividual return appointments 
will be easily managed.   Texts and a reminder postcard will both be utilized as a method to 
recall individuals for their second dose for optimal protection.  
 C. Provider Enrollment Data 
 COVID
-19 
provider 
enrollment data will be captured and stored in a relational database 
(Oracle
). This will allow the IIS team to easily query the data 
(using SQL
), transform it into 
CSV file format and report it electronically to CDC. T
he IIS Manager will be responsible for 
submitting the COVID
-19 Vaccination Provider Agreement data to CDC twice a week: 
Monday and Thursday by 9:00
 p.m. EST via the IZDL Partner Portal. The IIS Manager will run 
all necessary checks and audits to ensure that the data is complete and accurate bef
ore 
submitting to CDC
. D. Provider Credentialing 
 The COVID
-19 Provider Enrollment web app will verify provider license numbers with the 
IPLA
 database and will allow only valid and active licensed providers to be entered. The 
provider enrollment app intuitive
ly informs the user if the license number is found inactive 

or does not exist in the database. The application also allows for bulk upload of provider 
info via 
Excel file to reduce the burden of data entry. The bulk upload process will verify and 
automatic
ally add all providers with active license numbers. Those that could not be 
matched or inactive are indicated so the
y can be
 corrected
. E. Provider Training
 Training of COVID
-19 vaccination providers is vital to ensure the success of Indiana™s COVID
-19 vaccin
e implementation. Indiana will utilize CDC
-branded educational resources in 
addition to newly developed and pre
-existing IDOH materials. These educational training 
materials will complement each other. IDOH specific materials will focus on IDOH specific 
processes, such as CHIRP reporting. Training completion is tracked within the CHIRP training 
module. CDC will provide provider training for federal entities and commercial partners 

receiving direct vaccine allocations from CDC. 
 Indiana will use the 
CHIRP l
earning 
management 
system
, INvest.  INvest is a centralized 
training resource already developed for enrolled VFC providers that 
the IDOH
 utilize to train 
enrolled COVID
-19 providers.  This will include slightly modified training videos and tutorials 
on how 
to use the Vaccine Order Management System (VOMS) within CHIRP for ordering, 
receiving, inventory management in addition to vaccine storage and handling modules, 
vaccine administration, vaccine wastage and temperature excursions.
 The 
IDOH

 The system
 will also allow for a standardized training 
message and a tr

 F. Redistribution Approval 
 The IDOH will utilize the CDC™s COVID
-19 Vaccine Redistribution Agreement form for 
approval of redistribution by vaccine providers. 
The IDOH will develop an electronic, 
automated portal application for this form, similar to the COVID
-19 provider enrollment 
form. Not all providers will qualify and receive this form.  
 In instances where approval is justified, vaccination provider organiza
tions/facilities, third
-party vendors, and other vaccination providers will be allowed to redistribute vaccine. 
Approval is coordinated by IDOH™s immunization program and cold
-chain procedures are 
validated in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction
s and CDC™s guidance on 
COVID
-19 vaccine storage and handling.
 G. Equitable Vaccine Ac
cess 
 The 
IDOH
 Chief Medical Officer chairs a Vaccine Allocation Plan Development Advisory 
Group to determine the need by phases in each county of the state.  This data will
 be used 
to ensure an equitable distribution by phase across the state based on the percentage of 
healthcare workers in each county.      
   Indiana COVID

  Of Health
   The 
IDOH
 is 
using
 Tiberius as a visualization tool for allocations, data monitoring and 
transparency. Indiana has reg
istered individuals from the 
IDOH 
Immunizations
 Division
, Emergency Preparedness
 Division
, and the Office of Data & Analytics to ensure bench 
strength for this resource. Daily dashboards will be generated to illustrate vaccine 
administration, vaccine avail
ability and utilization.   
 Indiana has a robust pool of vaccinators including primary care physicians, pharmacists, and 

local health departments. 
Currently,
 743 providers 
are 
enrolled in the Indiana Vaccines for 
Children (VFC) Program 
who
 are actively va
ccinating and recording vaccination 
administration data in 
CHIRP.
 There are 1,923 other facilities that are administering vaccine in 
the 
State
 of Indiana and have established a bi
-directional interface with CHIRP.  With this 
coverage, the 
IDOH
 is confident
 in its 
ability
 to offer vaccine to vulnerable 
populations 
no matter where
 they 
reside.  
Figure 6
 provides
 a visual 
representation of all vaccine 
provider locations in 2019.  This 
includes private providers, local 

health, pharmacies, and 
healthcare/hospital locations.
 Pharm
acies are also great vaccinator 
in Indiana. In 2019, 5,336,699 
vaccines were administered to 
Hoosiers in the pharmacy setting
, illustrating the importance of 
including pharmacies in our plan for 
reaching vulnerable populations. 

Recent data from Walgreens s
tates 
that 90% of Hoosiers
 live w
ithin 10 
miles of a Walgreens store. The 

IDOH
 has had extensive 
conversations with Walgreens, 

Walmart, Meijer, and Kroger about 
their role in 
delivering 
COVID
-19 
vaccinations. The 
IDOH
 is also 
working with small independent
 pharmacies in rural areas to ensure 

additional vaccination touchpoints.    
 The 
IDOH
 will work with providers 
who
 have a history of vaccinating a large percentage of 
vulnerable populations to ensure that these providers to continue to provide services and
 build upon existing relationships. Data can be extrapolated from CHIRP on individuals 
who
 have been vaccinated over the age of 60 or at a specific provider type.  This data will be

 COVID
-19 VACCINE ADMINISTRATION CAPACITY 
 A. Administration Capacity 
 ﬁVaccine administration capacityﬂ is defined as the maximum achievable vaccination 
throughput regardless of public demand for vaccination. Public health programs shou
ld 
understand their jurisdiction™s overall potential COVID
-19 vaccine administration capacity 
using a variety of COVID
-19 vaccination provider types and settings. The sections below 
describe how vaccine administration capacity has and will be determine in 
relation to the 

three phases of vaccine distribution.  
 1. Phase 1
A  Information from hospitals, healthcare systems, and long

 that
 is

current
 data on capacity for vaccine administration within the state of Indiana. 
 As IDOH c
ontinues to engage with the Data Advisory Group and Vaccine Allocation Plan

, information on vaccine administration will continue to 
evolve and be added to
 IDOH plans to determine capacity for all hospitals 
statewide
 as 
well as de
termin
e their throughput rates, provider participation rates, and cold storage 
options
..   2. Phase 
1B Information from 
local 
health 
departments (LHDs) to be used for Phase 2 and beyond

   Data from this survey will also be used in Phase 3 as vaccine availability and 
administration capacity increase.   
 3. Phase 
2 Following the move into Phase 
2, the
 IDOH will take a more direct ro
le in vaccine 
administration through the use of 
strike 
teams and 
mobile 
units. These resources will 
allow IDOH to provide vaccines directly to the community, focusing specifically on 
populations with critical needs that have been identified in the LHD surv
ey described 
above. IDOH will work with LHDs to determine places where ability to distribute vaccine 
would have the greatest impact and plan accordingly. 
  Strike Teams
 The 
IDOH will utilize strike teams in the same manner that strike teams were utilized 
during 
COVID
-19 
sample collection and testing
:  teams will go to specific identified 
areas, either focusing on critical population groups or areas with abnormally high 
number
s of cases. These strike teams focused on long term care facilities during 
testing operations and will likely do the same during vaccine operations.  
 Mobile Units 
 The 
IDOH is obtaining 
ten
 mobile vans with cold storage to use for testing operations 
and v
accine distribution and administration.
 One 
mobile unit
, consisting of two 4
-person teams, 
will be 
based in each of the state™s 
ten
 preparedness districts
 and
 will 
be deployed to areas with a demonstrated need of support. It is expected that these 

mobile u
nits will have the same throughput capacity as a static testing site 
(approximately 80 
Œ 100 tested or vaccinated per day).  
 4. Provider Recruitment Plans
 Provider recruitment plans will be dictated by the phase of vaccine administration the 

state of Indiana
 is currently experiencing. IDOH will utilize the HHS data management 
and mapping tool, Tiberius, to visualize areas of low provider engagement. IDOH will 
ensure equitable access to all Hoosiers within the state by providing targeted provider 
outreach in t
hese areas.

each jurisdiction. 
The IDOH Immunization 

Division
 is responsible f

allotted will change over time. Multiple 
factors influence allotments, such as critical 

population estimates, product
ion and 
availability, and overall population within 

Indiana. 
 Allotments of doses to vaccination providers 

within Indiana will be based on the following 
criteria:
  ACIP recommendations (when 
available)
  Estimated number of doses allocated to Indiana and timing of availability
  Populations served by vaccination providers and geographic location to ensure 

equitable distribution throughout Indiana
  Vaccination provider site vaccine storage and handl
ing capacity
  Minimizing the potential wastage of vaccine, constituent products, and ancillary supplies
 Indiana will develop the allocation methods for critical populations in the early distribution 
of vaccines and in limited supply scenarios.
 This will be 
a combination of methods using 
Tiberius and then utilizing CHIRP and the pre
-booking module for each enrolled COVID
-19 
provider.
 This
 will be a percentage
-based process that will allow for the 
IDOH
 to base the 
total number of doses allocated from the CDC, 
accounting for the 
second
 dose, and 
determining the total number of doses of the critical population reported by the provider. 
Once the total number of doses allocated is determined, the percentage can be entered 
into the pre
-booking module.
 The system wil
l automatically determine the number of doses 
per provider for the ordering cycle. For example, if 100,000 doses 
are 
allocated to Indiana in 
the first order cycle, 
the IDOH
 will use a percentage process to send an equitable number 
of doses to all Phase 1A 
providers based on the reported critical population totals reported.
 For phase 1A
, the percentage of healthcare workers 
per county ha
s been calculated as a 
proportion to the state™s total healthcare worker population. If 
Indiana™s initial allocat
ion is 
ins
ufficient to vaccin
ate
 the entire healthcare workforce, allocations will be developed 
based on the facil
ity™s ability to vaccin
ate
 and 
county 
proportion
 of healthcare workers.

   B. Ordering 
 Registered COVID
-19 vaccination providers enrolled in CHIRP will order COVID
-19 vaccine 
through CHIRP. IDOH will utilize existing procedures routinely used for ordering publicly 
funded vaccines. This involves uploading orders received in CHIRP into CDC™s V
TrckS. 
 Indiana will initially complete the vaccine pre
-booking module process for the early vaccine 
orders
; once vaccines are more readily
 available, providers will be able to place orders for 
COVID
-19 vaccines directly in CHIRP™s Vaccine Order Management System (VOMS).  Once 
vaccine orders have been reviewed and approved in VOMS, orders will be flagged to be 

uploaded to VTrckS.   This proces
s involves uploading three separate files in the CDC™s EXiS 
system
: Provider Order Master, Provider Order Inventory, and Provider Order Orders.   
  Figure 
9: Screenshot of 
file upload 
of CHIRP ordering information into VTrckS.
 All files are uploaded in a 
.csv format
, and each contain specific information that 
is used to 
establish the new order requirements in VTrckS and must be uploaded in this order. If there 

are any errors in any line item of the upload process, the 
.csv file must be corrected before 
it 
will be accepted. All funding information must also meet the necessary funds codes and 
allocation limits set by the CDC. Any order that does not meet the allocation limits will be 

rejected and remain 
unapproved
 until allocation limits are reached.  
 CDC wi
ll provide 
the 
IDOH
 with regular updates on the available vaccine supply and 
vaccine product
-specific allocations. During 
Phase 1, when supply is limited to critical 
populations, 
the IDOH
 will approve orders based on the likely populations served by the 
vaccination provider, the provider™s capacity to store and handle the COVID
-19 vaccine 
products, and existing inventory. The minimum order size and increment for centrally 

distributed vaccines
 may be 
100
-1000
 doses per order
, dependent on
 updated CDC 
guidanc
e. Early in the response during 
Phase 1, some ultra
-cold vaccine (if authorized for 
use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in large quantities. 
 Ancillary supplies will be packaged in kits and will be automatically ordered in amount
s to 
match vaccine orders in VTrckS. 
 Each kit will contain supplies to administer 100 doses of 
vaccine, including:
  Needles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the order vaccination 
provider)
  Syringes, 105 per kit
  Alcohol prep pads, 21
0 per kit
  Surgical masks (4) and 
face 
shields (2) for vaccinators, per kit
  COVID
-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit
   Indiana COVID
-19 34 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   For COVID
-19 vaccines that require reconstitution with diluent or mixing with adjuvant at the 
point of administ
ration, mixing kits with syringes, needles, and other needed supplies will be 
included. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves, and bandages. 
Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be needed depending on vaccination 
provider site needs. 
 The 
IDOH has existing contracts for distribution assistance. Long
-standing relationships with 
other state agencies are also in place to expedite services for transportation and storage of 
supplies and goods. These same strategies will b
e utilized for vaccine supplies as needed.
 Facilities ordering outside of Indiana™s allocation (i.e., commercial and federal entities with 
federal MOUs in place) will order directly from CDC, and CDC will be responsible for 

approval of those orders.
 C. Distri
bution
  Figure 
10: Overview of distribution and administration of COVID
-19 vaccine from federal level to 
end
-user providers.
 The federal government will procure and distribute
 COVID
-19 vaccines and ancillary 
supplies at no cost to enrolled 
COVID
-19 vaccination providers. CDC will use its centralized 
distribution contract to fulfill orders for most vaccine products and associated ancillary 

supplies. Some vaccine products, such as those with ultra
-cold temperature requirements, 
will be shipped
 directly from the manufacturer to the vaccination provider site.
 Indiana will ensure accurate and complete shipping information (e.g., shipment address, 
provider contact information, shipping hours) is available in VTrckS for all vaccine shipments 
to enro
lled vaccination providers. 
The
 IDOH sent 
a survey to determine accurate POD 
  Indiana COVID
-19 35 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   addresses for all LHDs within Indiana. In addition, the survey also identified populations with 
critical needs within the populations each LHD serves. 
 The CDC™s 
central vaccine d
istributor, McKesson, has 
indicated
 some holiday ﬁblackoutﬂ 
days. During th
ese identified blackout days
, vaccine will not be shipped 
from the distributor
. The finalized blackout schedule is not 
available but
 will 
have 
fewer
 blackout periods
 compared to
 rou
tine VFC vaccine 
holiday blackout shipments.
 COVID
-19 vaccine (and diluent or adjuvant, if required) will be shipped to vaccination 
provider sites enrolled by 
the IDOH Immunization Divis
ion within 48 hours of order approval. 
Because of cold chain requireme
nts, ancillary supply kits (and diluent, if applicable) will ship 
separately from vaccine but should arrive before or on the same day as vaccine. 
 
The federally contracted vaccine distributor uses validated shipping procedures to maintain 
COVID
-19 vaccine 
cold chain and minimize the likelihood of vaccine loss or damage during 
shipment. Once a vaccine product has been shipped to a COVID
-19 vaccination provider 
site, the federal government will neither redistribute the product nor take financial 
responsibilit
y for its redistribution. 
 Whenever possible, vaccine should be shipped to the location where it will be administered 
to minimize potential breaks in the cold chain. However, there may be circumstances where 

COVID
-19 vaccine needs to be redistributed beyond the identified primary CD
C ship
-to sites 
(i.e., for orders smaller than the minimum order size or for large organizations whose 
vaccine is shipped to a central depot and requires redistribution to additional clinic 

locations). In these instances, vaccination provider organizations
/facilities, third
-party 
vendors, and other vaccination providers may be allowed, if approved by 
the IDOH 
Immunization Division
, to redistribute COVID
-19 vaccine if validated cold
-chain procedures 
are in place in accordance with the manufacturer's instruct
ions and CDC™s guidance on 
COVID
-19 vaccine storage and handling. These entities must complete and agree to 
conditions in the CDC COVID
-19 Vaccine Redistribution Agreement for the sending 
facility/organization and have a fully completed CDC COVID
-19 Vaccin
ation Provider Profile 
provider enrollment portal entry for each receiving location. 
The IDOH
 will be extremely 
judicious in allowing redistribution and limit any redistribution to refrigerated vaccines only. 
Redistribution of other vaccine temperatures is
 subject to change and guidance from CDC 
and manufactures.
 IDOH 
may
 allow local transport of vaccines
, when approved by IDOH,
 from one location to 
another if adherence to cold chain and tracking requirements are maintained. IDOH has 
surveyed local health d
epartments (LHDs) to determine the ability of LHDs to support local 
healthcare providers and entities. Redistribution beyond the initial designated primary CDC 
ship
-to location, must be conducted with the use of vaccine
-specific refrigerators and/or 
qualif
ied containers and pack
-outs. IDOH has engaged a dry ice vendor within Indiana to 
provide statewide services, if needed.

   D. Shipment Modalities
 The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) will assist with the distribution and administration of 
the vaccine. 
While the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will remain the 
lead agency for the federal COVID
-19 response, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will 
provide contract, logistics, and administrative support to the distribution process.
 1. Direct 
Shipment to Healthcare Providers and Pharmacies
 The 
IDOH,
 in coordination with 
LHDs,
 will recruit vaccine providers and sites to be 
COVID
-19 vaccine providers. Providers willing to administer the vaccine enroll with IDOH 
and agree to the requirements for r
eceiving, storing, administering, and tracking vaccine 
administration. Enrolled providers will place orders for the vaccine with the 
IDOH 
Immunization Division
.  The CDC provides each state a daily allocation of vaccine based on population, and the 
state w
ill prioritize and fill orders by the state immunization program against the 
allotment. Orders are then sent to the CDC, and vaccines will be shipped directly to the 
provider through a centralized vaccine distributor. For some critical workforce groups, 

the state will coordinate separate vaccine clinics with employers
, for example, hospitals 
or health systems to vaccinate their own workforce.
 2. Direct Shipment to Local Health Department for Distribution
 The 
IDOH
 will allocate a portion of COVID
-19 vaccines to
 LHDs for administration and 
outreach within their communities.
 3. Direct Shipment to IDOH for Local Distribution 
 The 
IDOH
 will administer some of the vaccine through state
-run vaccination sites. To 
support these operations, some vaccine allocations will be 
directly shipped to 
the
 IDOH 
warehouse. The IDOH warehouse has the capability of distributing vaccine and ancillary 

supplies to 
LHDs
, healthcare providers, and IDOH
-operated mobile units.

   E. Inventory Management 
 COVID
-19 vaccination providers will be required to report inventory of COVID
-19 vaccines. 
Indiana has a process in CHIRP for ensuring that vaccine inventory is submitted prior to 
placing a vaccine order.  
The IDOH
 current
ly 
requires
 that provider
s submit their vaccine 
inventory within 14 days of submitting a vaccine order, preferably the same day the order is 
being placed.  This process
, vaccine reconciliation
, allows the provider to document if any 
doses were wasted or re
-distributed (transferred) during the time period since the last 
vaccine order was placed.   This information will be essential in maintaining accountability of 
all COVID
-19 doses through the ordering and vaccination process.  
 It is anticipated that the C
OVID
-19 vaccine will initially be authorized under an 
FDA 
EUA. 
Vaccines authorized under an EUA will contain slight variation from approved FDA products, 
including:
  Expiration Date
: The vaccine vials and cartons will not contain a printed expiration date. 
Expiration dates may be updated based on vaccine stability studies occurring 
simultaneously with COVID
-19 vaccine distribution and administration. Current expiration 
dates by vacci
ne lots for all authorized COVID
-19 vaccines will be posted on 
the 
HHS 
website (weblink pending), accessible to all COVID
-19 vaccination providers. To ensure 
that information systems continue to work as expected, CDC has worked with FDA and 

the manufacture
rs to include a two
-dimensional (2D) barcode on the vaccine vial (if 
possible) and carton (required) labels that includes a National Drug Code (NDC), lot 
number, and a placeholder expiration date of 12/31/9999 to be read by a scanner. The 
placeholder 12/31
/9999 expiration date is not visible on the vaccine packaging nor 
found anywhere else; it is only to facilitate information system compatibility. CDC is 
developing ﬁbeyond use dateﬂ (BUD) tracker labels to assist clinicians with tracking 
expiration dates a
t the point of vaccine administration. The label templates will be 
available on the CDC website. 
  Manufactured Date
: A manufactured date will be on the packaging and should not be 
used as the expiration date when documenting vaccine administration. This da
te is 
provided to help with managing stock rotations; however, expiration dates should also 
be considered (see above) as using manufactured date alone could have some 
limitations. 
  2D Barcode
: The 2D barcode available on the vaccine carton (also on the via
ls for some 
vaccines) will include NDC, lot number, and a placeholder expiration date of 
12/31/9999. 
  QR Code
: Each vaccine manufacturer will include a Quick Response (QR) code on the 
vaccine carton for accessing FDA
-authorized, vaccine product
-specific EUA fact sheets 
for COVID
-19 vaccination providers and COVID
-19 vaccine recipients. 
   Indiana COVID
-19 38 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   A list of authorized COVID
-19 vaccine products with corresponding EUA fact sheets for 
healthcare providers and vaccine recipients, and up
-to-date information by vaccine lot will 
be available o
n the CDC and HHS website
s for public access.
 F. COVID
-19 Vaccine Recovery 
 COVID
-19 vaccine 
products are temperature
-sensitive and must be stored and handled 
correctly to ensure efficacy and maximize shelf life. Proper storage and handling practices 
are critical to minimize vaccine loss and limit risk of administering COVID
-19 vaccine with 
reduce
d effectiveness. Indiana will work with staff at each COVID
-19 vaccination provider 
site to ensure appropriate vaccine storage and handling procedures are established and 
followed. 
 It is expected that cold chain storage and handling requirements for COVID
-19 vaccine 
products will vary in temperature from refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) to frozen (
-15 to 
-25°C) to 
ultra
-cold (
-60°C to 
-80°C in the freezer or within the dry ice shipping container in which 
product was received). Ongoing stability testing may impact
 these requirements. 
For a 
reliable cold chain, three elements must be in place: 
  Well
-trained staff 
  Reliable storage and temperature monitoring equipment 
  Accurate vaccine inventory management 
 The cold chain begins at the COVID
-19 vaccine manufacturing 
plant, includes delivery to 
and storage at the COVID
-19 vaccination provider site, and ends with administration of 
COVID
-19 vaccine. 
The
 IDOH and vaccination providers are responsible for maintaining 
vaccine quality from the time a shipment arrives at a va
ccination provider site until the dose 
is administered. To minimize opportunities for breaks in the cold chain, most COVID
-19 
vaccine will be delivered from CDC™s centralized distributor directly to the location where 
the vaccine will be stored and adminis
tered, although some vaccine may be delivered to 
secondary depots for redistribution. Certain COVID
-19 vaccine products, such as those with 
ultra
-cold temperature requirements, will be shipped directly from the manufacturer to the 
vaccination provider site
 The 
IDOH will have mechanisms in place to provide pro
-active support for vaccine recovery
 and
 will continually monitor vaccine usage, to determine if state
-level intervention is 
required. 
The 
IDOH is prepared to help support
 dry ice replenishment
 through 
a state
-contracted vendor when local resources are exhausted.
 Any unused products nearing 
expected usage deadlines will be evaluated for redistribution to other locations. 
The 
IDOH 
will utilized the redistribution strategy outlined above in the distributio
n section.
 G. Satellite, Temporary, and Off
-Site Clinic Storage and Handling 
 Satellite, temporary, or off
-site clinics in collaboration with community or mobile vaccinators 
will assist in providing equitable access for COVID
-19 vaccination. However, these si
tuations 
require additional oversight and enhanced storage and handling practices, including: 
   Indiana COVID
-19 39 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
    The quantity of COVID
-19 vaccine transported to a satellite, temporary, or off
-site 
COVID
-19 vaccination clinic should be based on the anticipated number of COVI
D-19 
vaccine recipients and the ability of the vaccination provider to store, handle, and 
transport the vaccine appropriately. This is essential to minimizing the potential for 
vaccine wastage and spoilage. 
  COVID
-19 vaccines may be transported
Šnot shipped
Što a satellite, temporary, or off
-site COVID
-19 vaccination clinic setting using vaccine transportation procedures 
outlined in CDC™s Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit. The procedures will include 
transporting vaccines to and from the provider site at a
ppropriate temperatures, using 
appropriate equipment, as well as monitoring and documenting temperatures. 
  Upon arrival at the COVID
-19 vaccination clinic site, vaccines must be stored correctly to 
maintain appropriate temperature throughout the clinic day
.   Temperature data must be reviewed and documented according to guidance in the 

CDC™s Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit. 
  At the end of the clinic day, temperature data must be assessed prior to returning 
vaccine to fixed storage units to prevent admin
istration of vaccines that may have been 
compromised. 
  As with all vaccines, if COVID
-19 vaccines are exposed to temperature 
fluctuations 
at 
any time, the temperature excursion should be documented and reported according to 
the IDOH Immunization program pr
ocedures for temperature reporting through CHIRP. 
The vaccines that were exposed to out
-of-range temperatures must be labeled ﬁdo not 
useﬂ and stored at the required temperature until further information
.  H. Local Dispensing
 Two models will be utilized to di
stribute the vaccine 
Œ push and pull. Indiana will use a 
variety of methods to dispense 
vaccines:
 distribution directly to residents through state
-administered
 vaccine sites (strike teams or mobile teams)
 or 
LHD
 POD
s, local agencies 
and
/or
 private sector p
artners. When selecting a strategy, 
the
 IDOH will consider 
operational capacity, the amount of vaccine available, available staff, and facility 
requirements.
 1. Vaccine Providers 
 LHD PODs
 LHDs
 utilize a pull model to allow the public to retrieve vaccines from PODs (e.g., 
drive
-through clinics, clinics established at schools, and other areas). LHDs will utilize 
pre
-existing POD plans to register, administer, and document the COVID
-19 vaccine.
 Private Partners and Major Retail Providers 
 Private health care providers, hospitals, and retail pharmacies 
enrolled
 will be able to 
administer
 the COVID
-19 vaccine. The vaccine will be direct shipped to their facility 
  Indiana COVID
-19 40 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   from the federal government™s distribu
tor. These entities will report vaccine 
administration to 
the 
IDOH.
 IDOH Mobile Units 
 The 
IDOH COVID
-19 mobile testing units will serve as multi
-purpose mobile 
vaccination clinics. The mobile units will utilize a push model requiring state officials 
to pu
sh the vaccine out to entities who are responsible for delivering the vaccine to 
specific populations. The mobile units will conduct outreach to vulnerable and at
-risk 
populations across the state. The units are pre
-positioned in the 
ten
 preparedness 
distr
icts and ready to respond to requests from LHDs and other state
-directed 
initiatives.
 Given the disproportionate burden of COVID
-19 on communities of color, the elderly, 
and individuals in congregate care settings, ﬁpush modelsﬂ into communities that 
face 
barriers to vaccine access will be important to support equitable distribution for 
those most at
-risk.
 2. Vaccine Surge Support 
 Indiana National Guard (INNG) medics may be available as a surge support option to 
provide increased manpower to administer vaccin
es in Indiana. 
To utilize INNG medics 
for vaccine administration, current certification by the National 
Registry of EMTs will 
need to be elevated
, and an exception approved by IDOH 
leadership and IDHS
-EMS in 
order to administer vaccine to civilians. INNG g
eneral laborers may also be utilized to 
provided registration and administrative assistance at dispensing locations. Support 
from the INNG can be requested through the State Emergency Operations Center 
(SEOC) for State Active Duty (SAD), if approved by IDH
S.  Indiana EMS and paramedicine 
providers can be utilized to provide vaccine administration and support. Coordination 

with the IDHS and local EMS providers will be leveraged to provide surge support 
locally.
 State leaders will review state laws and consid
er the legal implications of utilizing state 
emergency laws to expand existing scopes of practices for vaccine administration. 
Below are examples of modified scopes utilized during the H1N1 pandemic and the 
state adopting each strategy.

products will vary in temperature from refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) to frozen (
-15°C to 
-25°C) to ul
tra
-cold (
-60°C to 
-80°C in the freezer or within the dry ice shipping container in which product was 
received). Ongoing stability testing may impact these requirements. 
 For a reliable cold chain, three elements must be in place:
  Well
-trained staff 
  Relia
ble storage and temperature monitoring equipment 
  Accurate vaccine inventory management 
 The cold chain begins at the COVID
-19 vaccine manufacturing plant, includes delivery to and 
storage at the COVID
-19 vaccination provider site, and ends with administra
tion of COVID
-19 
vaccine. IDOH and vaccination providers are responsible for maintaining vaccine quality from 
the time a shipment arrives at a vaccination provider site until the dose is administered. To 
minimize opportunities for breaks in the cold chain,
 most COVID
-19 vaccine will be delivered 
from CDC™s centralized distributor directly to the location where the vaccine will be stored and 
administered, although some vaccine may be delivered to secondary depots for redistribution. 
Certain COVID
-19 vaccine 
products, such as those with ultra
-cold temperature requirements, 
will be shipped directly from the manufacturer to the vaccination provider site. If redistributing 
vaccine, all cold chain requirements 
must be adhered to 
and should limit transport of froze
n or 
ultra
-cold vaccine products.
 A. Cold Chain Management 
 Cold chain storage and handling requirements for each COVID
-19 vaccine product will vary 
from refrigerated (20°C to 80°C) to frozen (
-20°C) to ultra
-cold (
-60°C to 
-80°C) temperatures, 
and ongoing st
ability testing may impact these requirements. 
 Some 
vaccine will require ultra
-low cold (ULC) chain. Ultra
-low cold chain can go as low as 
-
-coolers, freezers, coolers, and other cold storage solutions will be utilized to 
maintain the vaccine 
designated temperature. Temperatures are tracked on a continual 
basis and are reported and stored in 
CHIRP
. The 
IDOH
 has a network of 750 healthcare providers with the capacity to store and transport 
publicly funded vaccine.  Each of the 750 healthcare pro
viders enrolled in the program have 
stand
-alone vaccine storage equipment with continuous temperature monitoring 
equipment.  
   Indiana COVID
-19 45 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   Once vaccine has been ordered and received, strict storage and handling guidelines must 
be followed. Vaccines are temperature
-sens
itive and must be stored and handled correctly 
to ensure efficiently and maximize shelf
-life.
 B. Temperature Monitoring 
 Indiana will be working on determining the best method for continuous monitoring of all 
COVID
-19 vaccines, including ultra
-cold vaccines. 
  The IDOH
 currently use data loggers for 
all vaccine temperature monitoring in all permanent storage units and all vaccine transport 
units
 and
 will require that all providers utilize continuous monitoring systems and will 
provide these, as needed.   
 CHIR
P has the capability to allow providers to enter their daily temp
erature
s (min/max
). The 
system also has the ability for providers to upload their daily temp
erature
 log in a specified 
format. IDOH vaccine ordering management staff can set up alerts when temperature 
excursions are recorded within 
CHIRP
. Figure 
11 depicts 
the 
temperature recording feature 
within CHIRP.
  Figure 
12: temperature monitoring interface in C
HIRP.
 C. Strategy to Engage Dry Ice Vendor 
 The (IDOH will follow the Indiana Department of Administration (IDOA) Delegation of 
Purchasing Authority Program (DPAP) guidelines for procurement of goods and services.  
No less than three vendors will be contacted for their services/products. Vendor sele
ction 
will be performed as required by the DPAP guidelines, by an authorized purchasing agent, 
and approved by IDOA procurement approvers.  The method of selection will be by 
competitive bid or special procurement by justification of emergency need, review
ed and 
approved by the IDOA 
procurement approvers. Once selected a requisition and purchase 
order will be created, approved and dispatched to the vendor. The vendor will be contacted 
  Indiana COVID
-19 46 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   with delivery locations 24 hours prior to when products are needed and wi
ll invoice 
accordingly.
 D. Redistribution Transportation
 The IDOH will leverage existing private and public partners in the transportation of 
redistributed COVID
-19 vaccine. Existing partners include, the Indiana Department of 
Transportation (INDOT) and priva
te logistics company, Langham Logistics. 
The identified 
modalities
 have the ability to provide temperature
-controlled transportation. Transportation 
will include transit to LHD
-operated clinics, state
-operated mobile sites, and other health 
care provider l
ocations. Supplies transported include the vaccine and ancillary supplies. 
LHDs have been surveyed to determine their ability to support redistribution locally. Finally, 

another redistribution option available to 
the
 IDOH is its 
ten
 mobile response vehicle
s, prepositioned in the 
ten
 Indiana 
preparedness districts 
and
 available to provide testing, 
vaccine, and outbreak response support across the state. Each vehicle is outfitted with cold 
storage capabilities.
  As 
vaccine is redistributed, 
the 
IDOH will leverage the systems 
identified in 
Section IX
: Vaccine Administration Documentation and Reporting
 to track the 
movement
 of the vaccine.

 COVID
-19 VACCINE ADMINISTRATION DOCUMENTATION AND 
REPORTING
 A. Collection of COVID
-19 Vaccine Doses Adminstered Data
 1. CHIRP
 Immunization information systems (IISs), also known as vaccine registries, are 
confidential, population
-based computerized systems for recording information, 
including vaccination history and vaccine doses given by 
participating health care 
providers. 
 Within the state of Indiana, the Children and Hoosier Immunization Registry Program 
(CHIRP) is utilized. CHIRP is a secure web
-based application administered by the IDOH. 
CHIRP is a lifespan registry designed to perman
ently store a person™s immunization 
records in an electronic format. Healthcare providers can use the registry to both review 
vaccination records for their patients and to record all newly administered vaccinations. 

The 
State of Indiana mandates the report
ing of vaccine administration by certain age 
groups and provider types.   
 Interfaces with electronic health records and data clearinghouses account for 90% of all 
data reported to 
CHIRP
.  This data is reported using a Health Level Seven (HL7) 
message.  A 
HL7
 message is an international standard for the transfer of clinical and 
administrative data between software applications.  Indiana Code requires the 
information to be reported within seven days of vaccine administration.     
 The 
IDOH is working with a 
third
-party vendor to help providers collect vaccine dose 
level info and report to the registry.
 PrepMod is currently being evaluated as an option.
  Existing IIS providers reporting electronically
 -- Providers 
who
 are currently reporting 
to the IIS will con
tinue to report COVID
-19 
dose
-level information
 as they do other 
vaccines. The only change in their workflow is that COVID
-19 administered doses will 
need to be reported with 24 hours of administration.
  IIS direct data entry
 -- Providers have the option to
 directly log into the IIS and record 
patient and vaccine info. The IIS has 
several
 functions available for providers to 
monitor inventory at the dose level by vaccine, lot number, and other parameters as 
well as track wastage and returns.  
 2. PrepMod
 The ID
OH is 
currently evaluating
 a third
-party vendor, PrepMod, 
as an option 
to help 

manages key aspects of mass vaccination efforts and pandemic responses.  It connects 
t
reporting, and monitoring of uptake, coverage, and supply inventory.  It features online 
  Indiana COVID
-19 48 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   
 interfaces with state IISs and other electronic systems. 
      B. Transition of Data to IZ Gateway 
 The 
IDOH has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and data use agreement 
(DUA) to connect and shared vaccination data via the 
Immunization (
IZ) Gateway.
 We are 
working with 
the
 IIS vendor and 
American Immunization Registry Association 
(AIRA
) to set 
the connections up between the IIS and the IZ
 Gateway. Once the connections have been 
set within the IIS, the system will able to query for a patient with all 
states connected to the 
IZ Gateway 
to which the IIS has access. The IZ
 Gateway will automatically report to the IIS 
any I
ndiana
 patient 
who
 got 
a 
vaccine dose in any of the 
states connected to the IZ
 Gateway.
 C. Provider Reporting Readiness 
 The 
IDOH ensures that each COVID
-19 vaccination provider is ready and able to report 
COVID
-19 vaccine administration and inventory information into CHIRP. The reported 
information includes the CDC
-defined required data elements. Indiana will use the 
learning 
management 
system within CHIRP, called INvest.  INvest is a centralized training resource 
already developed for enrolled VFC providers that 
the IDOH
 will utilize to train enrolled 
COVID
-19 provider
s. This provider training ensures provider reporting readine
ss. Providers 
must ensure that they have trained staff, internet connection, and adequate reporting 

equipment to report vaccine administration data elements every 24 hours.
 D. Real
-Time Reporting 
 Satellite, temporary and off
-site clinics will be able to dire
ctly enter data to the IIS via 
manual data. 
CHIRP
 is a web
-based app and is accessible via any internet enabled device. 
and
 has a standalone inter op engine
, PHC
-Hub
, that handles all electronic data reported to 
the system. All data that is sent to PHC
-Hub
 is set for immediate deduplication which will 
enable ~90% of the data reported to 
CHIRP
 to be instantly available to the providers to be 
viewed or queried.
 E. Provider Accountability 
 The Vaccine Ordering Module is a part of the IIS which gives 
IDOH administ
rative
 staff full 
access to provider inventory. The IIS also has several inbuilt reports that will help staff 

monitor inventory, doses administered
, and reported to the system
 (see Figure 
10). IIS staff 
also have access to the IIS database run ad
 hoc repor
ts using database queries to monitor 
data for completeness, timeliness, and accuracy. Immunization and IIS staff will follow
-up 
with providers that do not comply with the documentation and reporting requirement to 

ensure compliance. Further future order re
quests from these provider
s can be denied for 
failing to meet with the 
program requirements. Appropriate disciplinary actions will be 
determined on an as needed basis, if on
-time reporting issues occur.

. F. COVID
-19 Vaccine Reports
 The 
IDOH
 will use CHIRP to generate reports on vaccine utilization by provider, county, and 
the state on at least a weekly basis.  This function
ality is existing and will be set up as a 
canned report to be automatically generated on a regular interval.  This information will be 
submitted to the 
IDOH 
Office of Data and Analytics for inclusion in dashboards and to 
analyze vaccine utilization in area
s of the state.     
 The 
IDOH
 has recently registered and been granted access to the 
HHS
 application, Tiberius. 
and
 will use Tiberius as an additional tool for assessing vaccine coverage in high risk areas 
and targeting areas of low vaccine utilization.   
  These two data utilities will enable the 
State of Indiana to track vaccine utilization across the 
state and look for pockets of need.  If pockets of need are identified, the 
IDOH
 will work with 
community vaccination partners to increase vaccination effor
ts in that area.  
LHD
 efforts are 
  Indiana COVID
-19 50 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   being positioned as back
-up vaccinators for identified areas of need or as a vaccination 
touchpoint for areas of the state that do not have other vaccination resources.  
 Areas of low vaccination utilization will be provid
ed to the State Health Commissioner on a 
weekly basis so that 
IDOH 
leadership is aware of the issue and can allocate resources to 
address coverage.  
 
The 
IDOH
 will also use CHIRP to track the number of individuals 
who
 received a first dose of 
COVID
-19 vacc
ine and need a second dose.  Daily reports will be run to determine 
individuals that need a second dose and what presentation was previously received so that 
reminder recalls can be generated for series completion.  Daily reports will also be 
generated on 
the number of individuals that are fully protected against the virus due to be 

fully vaccinated per ACIP recommendations.

   X. COVID
-19 VACCINATION SECOND
-DOSE REMINDERS 
 A. Notification Timing and Product Type 
 For most COVID
-19 vaccine products, two
 doses of vaccine, separated by 
at least 21
 days, 
will be needed. Because different COVID
-19 vaccine products will not be interchangeable, a 
vaccine recipient™s second dose must be from the same manufacturer as 
the
 first dose. 
Second
-dose reminders for vac
cine recipients will be critical to ensure compliance with 
vaccine dosing intervals and achieve optimal vaccine effectiveness. COVID
-19 vaccination 
providers should make every attempt to schedule a patient™s second
-dose appointment 
when they get their firs
t dose.
 B. Notification Modalities 
 Redundant methods and systems will be used to remind vaccine recipients about their 
need for second doses. Indiana will utilize current practices for patient reminder/recall in 
existing healthcare provider organizations and
 pharmacies, such as through healthcare 
electronic health records (EHRs).
 1. Vaccination Record Cards (included in ancillary kits)
 COVID
-19 vaccination record cards will be provided as part of vaccine ancillary kits. 
Vaccination providers should be highly enc
ouraged to complete these cards with 
accurate vaccine information (i.e., vaccine manufacturer, lot number, date of first dose 

administration, and second dose due date), and give them to each patient who receives 
vaccine to ensure a basic vaccination record
 is provided. Vaccination providers should 
encourage vaccine recipients to keep the card in case the IIS or other system is not 

available when they return for their second dose. The card provides room for a written 
reminder for a second
-dose appointment. I
f vaccine recipients have a smartphone, they 
may consider documenting their vaccine administration with a photo of their vaccination 
record and entering the date the next vaccine dose is due on their electronic calendar.
 2. CHIRP Reminder Recall
 CHIRP has a r
eminder recall option
 with
 ability to send emails and text messages to 
vaccine recipients. This option is only available if the patient information is available and 

accurate within the registry. 
 3. Postcards
 The 
IDOH has budgeted supplemental funding for sec
ond dose reminder postcards, 
printing, and postage. The postcard information and distribution schedule would be 
determined by information collected in CHIRP.
 4. Scheduling of Second Dose During First Dose Administration
 During Phase 1, providers may 
choose to pre
-schedule a second dose appointment at 
the same vaccination site. This option will be utilized in occupational health settings 
where site operations and scheduling are more predictable and anticipated. This option 

is currently being evaluated 
for utilization within Phase 2 and Phase 3.

   5. Electronic 
Medical
 Records (E
MR) Many health systems, provider offices, and pharmacy locations within Indiana have 
robust electronic 
medical
 records (
EMR
) systems. Similar to routine vaccination 
reminders, providers will utilize E
MR notifications to remind patients of a need for a 
second

 COVID
-19 REQUIREMENTS FOR IIS OR OTHER EXTERNAL SYSTEMS 
 A. High
-Volume Data Management and Contingency
 The 
IDOH has developed solutions for documenting vaccine administration in temporary 
and high
-volume vaccination settings. Planned contingencies fo
r network outages and 
other potential access issues are included. 
 1. In case of providers using the CDC VAMS application to record and track COVID
-19 
doses, 
CHIRP
 will receive these via the IZ Gateway. 
 2. CHIRP
 currently has a 
mass 
immunization module (MIM) to
 handle high volume data. 
However
, the current MIM does not have the ability to collect all the COVID
-19 info that 
CDC is requiring jurisdictions to collect. Our IIS vendor is working on updates to this MIM 
to able to collect more info than what is being c
ollected now
 with t
he targeted date for 
completion of these updates in the month of December.

 D. IIS Enrollment and Onboarding 
 The 
IDOH plans to rapidly enroll and onboard providers to CHIRP. 
The 
IDOH will roll out an 
online COV
ID-19 provider enrollment application to electronically collect information and 
store in a relational database. 
The IDOH is
 currently 
determining
 with 
the IIS
 vendor if this 
info

hire
 1-2 data 
entry contract staff to transfer the enrollment info to the IIS. In addition, 
the IDOH is
 also in 
the process of hiring an onboarding contact staff to help with 
onboarding providers who will 
report data to the IIS electronically.
 E. IZ Ga
teway Connection 
 The 
IDOH has executed a memorandum of understand (MOU) and data use agreement 
(DUA) to connect and share vaccination data via the IZ Gateway. 
the
 IDOH is working with 
the IIS vendor and AIRA to set the connections up with the IZ Gateway.
 F. Data Use Agreements 
 The 
IDOH has established DUAs with the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHA) 
to participate in the IZ Gateway. A DUA has been established with CDC for national 

coverage analysis. Finally,

 COVID
-19 VACCINATION PROGRAM COMMUNICATION 
 Starting before 
COVID
-19 vaccines are available, clear, effective communication will be 
essential to implementing a successful COVID
-19 vaccination program. Building vaccine 
confidence broadly and among groups anticipated to receive early vaccination, as well as 
dispellin
g vaccine misinformation, are critical to ensure vaccine uptake.
 A. COVID
-19 Communication Objectives 
  Ensure public confidence in the approval or authorization process, safety, and efficacy 
of COVID
-19 vaccines. 
  Help the public to understand key differences
 in FDA 
EUA
 and FDA approval (i.e., 
licensure). 
  Engage in dialogue with internal and external partners to understand their key 
considerations and needs related to COVID
-19 vaccine program implementation. 
  Ensure active, timely, accessible, and effective p
ublic health and safety messaging 
along with outreach to key state/local partners and the public about COVID
-19 vaccines. 
  Provide guidance to local health departments, clinicians, and other hosts of COVID
-19 
vaccination provider locations. 
  Track and moni
tor public receptiveness to COVID
-19 vaccination messaging.
 B. Key Audiences 
 A robust and nimble communication plan will be the foundation of successful COVID
-19 
vaccine allocation and uptake. The focus must be on ensuring consumer trust by providing 
informa
tion that is timely, accurate and appropriate. Messages will be crafted specific
ally
 to 
each audience and distributed through the most effective channels to achieve the 
maximum response. 
 Key audiences identified include
:  Critical infrastructure workers
  Emergency preparedness districts 
and health care coalitions
  Employers and businesses
  Federally
-Qualified
 Health Centers 
(FQHCs) and community clinics
  Faith
-based communities
  General public (at
-risk groups 
those mostly likely to spread 
COVID
-19 or develop serious  
illness)
  Healthcare providers and 
pharmacists 
  Law enforcement and corrections
  Local health depa
rtments 
  Long
-term care facilities
  Media
 C. Broad Communication Planning Phases 
 Communication of Indiana™s COVID
-19 vaccination plan will be coordinated by the 
IDOH
 Office of Public Affairs (OPA). The OPA team has already begun to 
inform key stakeholders 
of the planning process already under way at the state level. 
The IDOH has
 also engaged 
partners as 
plans are developed
 for both the initial Phase 1
-A vaccination distribution and 
mass vaccination clinics.
   Indiana COVID
-19 57 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   OPA is also working with a
gency leadership and the Vaccination Allocation Advisory 
Committee as each phase of the vaccine implementation plan is defined and establishing a 
communication plan that corresponds to the overarching operationalization of the 
vaccination program.
  Phase 1
: Potentially Limited COVID
-19 Vaccine Doses Available
 o Healthcare workers, EMS, long
-term care staff and residents, local health 
departments, emergency preparedness districts and healthcare coalitions
  Phase 2
: Large Number of Doses Available; Supply Likely 
to Meet Demand
 o Corrections, other critical infrastructure workers, other congregate settings
  Phase 3
: Likely Sufficient Supply
 o General public with focus on developing strategies to ensure equitable access to 
COVID
-19 vaccination services
 The IDOH
 established a communication 
plan to guide the communication process 
throughout the vaccine program operation, 
with timelines and tracking mechanisms to 
ensure that communications are timely 
and proactive as much as possible, yet 
flexible to adjust to prog
ram changes, 
including supply and other available 

information.
  D. Communication Activties 
 OPA
 reviews research and monitors social 
media awareness regarding the public™s 
perception of the COVID
-19 vaccine. This 
information will help guide messaging to 
ensur
e that communication addresses the 
barriers that most influence vaccine 
uptake.
 Initial areas of focus:
  About half of U.S. adults (51%) say they 
would definitely or probably get a vaccine 

to prevent COVID
-19 if it were available 
today.
  Individual barriers to vaccine acceptance, such as 
fear of side effects, low perception 
of the efficacy, negative past exper
iences with vaccination services, lack of 
knowledge, are discussed as well as the broader sociocultural context
.  African
 American adults are much less likely to say they would get a vaccine than other 
Americans
. Figure 
14: Pew Research Center survey 
results on COVID
-19 vaccine interest.
   Indiana COVID
-19 58 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
    Concerns about 
side effects and uncertainty 
around the effectiveness of a vaccine
 are 
widely cited as reasons by those who would not get a COVID
-19 vaccine if one were 
available today.
  Fewer adults cite 
not thinking they need the vaccine
 (31%) or the 
vaccine™s cost
 (13%) 
as a major reason they would
 not likely get vaccinated.

information. Verify that outreach is made with intent and efficiency.
  Ensure that communication meets 
accessibility guidelines and other requirements for 
those with disab
ilities as well as language requirements.
  Host focus groups throughout the state to identify barriers to vaccine uptake and inform 

communications strategy.

    Track and provide education about vaccine safety and efficacy to create materials to 
address vaccina
tion barriers.
  Communicate updates to the media through weekly press briefings and as needed 
based on the information available.
  Provide support for local health departments, including a toolkit to help promote local 
vaccination clinics and regular updates
 through weekly webcasts.
  Use existing listservs and the Indiana Health Alert Network to provide messaging 
directly to healthcare providers to share with patients.
  Create media campaign aimed at increasing uptake of COVID

 E. Mes
saging Considerations 
 All communication will be presented clearly and crafted with the specific audience in mind. 
This will include consultation with the 
IDOH 
Office of Minority Health and translations as 
needed. Placement of the messages will also incorp
orate a variety of delivery methods.
 Key content to be covered in communication efforts
:  Vaccine is available
  Cost
  Info
rmation
 on safety/efficacy
  Addressing psychological barriers
  The why: for family, for community
  What 
happens after vaccination
 All communications will pass the 
accessibility checker to ensure they can be available to 
those with 
disabilities
. The IDOH
 will also utilize in
-house translation services, as well as 
help from partners 
to provide translations in Spanish, Chinese, Creole and Burmese to 
further address any communication barriers to ensure access and understanding of COVID
-19 vaccination.
 Messaging will need to be layered, starting with simple messaging about vaccine 
availa
bility and effectiveness and addressing any psychological barriers to vaccine uptake. 
Other messaging will be more detailed, such as 
what is
 available on the website where the 
public can find more detailed information. 
 Targeted outreach to rural areas and
 other specific communities, such as Amish or 
Potowatomi Indian populations, will also be necessary to provide direct outreach to those 
who may not have access to information or fewer healthcare resources in less populated 
areas of the state.
 Messaging wil
l begin with outreach to the Phase 1A key audiences, including healthcare 
providers and associations and the local health departments so they can begin 
preparations.

) H. Crisis and Risk Communication 
 In a health emergency, people make decisions differently. They tend to simplify the issues 
to 
for
 easier 
understanding
 with so much new and changing information. They also cling to 
current beliefs as a way to provide stability during a difficult period. Pe
ople may refer to 
what they have seen or have previously experienced, which means that first messages 

carry more weight. Our driving principles are to be first, be right and be credible while 
adhering to the values, goals and initiatives of the 
IDOH
.   Indiana COVID
-19 62 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   In th
is public health crisis, 
it is
 essential that we initially communicate: 
  Simply 
  Timely 
  Accurately 
  Repeatedly 
  Credibly 
  Consistently 
 We can build trust and credibility by expressing: 
  Empathy and caring 
  Competence and expertise 
  Honesty and openness 
  Commitment and dedication 
 The goal of our messaging 
is to acknowledge uncertainty and fears and to reassure as 
appropriate with facts a
nd information from credible sources. 
The IDOH
 also want
s to give 
people action items to help reduce their anxiety about the vaccine, which will include 
resources for detailed and consistent talking points and resources to find additional 
information. 
The 
IDOH
 will be knowledgeable and transparent to build trust and credibility in 
all fact sheets, media releases, social media posts and other communication resources with 

the public and various stakeholders through the appropriate channels.

 REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS FOR COVID
-19 VACCINATIONS
 A. Emergency Use Authorization Fact Sheets 
 The EUA authority allows the FDA to authorize either (a) the use of an unapproved medical 
product (e.g., drug, vaccine, or diagnostic device) or (b) the unapproved
 use of an approved 
medical product during an emergency based on certain criteria. The EUA will outline how 

the COVID
-19 vaccine should be used and any conditions that must be met to use the 
vaccine. FDA will coordinate with CDC to confirm these ﬁcondition
s of authorization.ﬂ 
Vaccine conditions of authorization are expected to include distribution requirements, 

reporting requirements, and safety and monitoring requirements. The EUA will be 
authorized for a specific time period to meet response needs (i.e., 
for the duration of the 
COVID
-19 pandemic). 
 Product
-specific EUA fact sheets for COVID
-19 vaccination providers will be made available 
that will include information on the specific vaccine product and instructions for its use. An 
EUA fact sheet for vaccin
e recipients will also be developed, and both will be made 
available on the FDA website and through the CDC website. Indiana will ensure providers 
know where to find both the provider and recipient fact sheets, have read and understand 
them, and are clear 
on the requirement to provide the recipient fact sheet to each 

client/patient prior to administering vaccine.
 Indiana will use 
INvest, 
the 
learning 
management 
system within CHIRP.  INvest is a 
centralized training resource already developed for enrolled VF
C providers that 
the IDOH
 will utilize to train enrolled COVID
-19 providers.  
The IDOH
 will develop training modules for 
EUA fact sheets for providers and vaccine recipients, and Vaccine Information Statements 
(VIS).  The system will instruct enrolled COVI
D-19 providers to provide EUA fact sheets or 
VIS, as applicable, to each vaccine recipient prior to vaccine administration.  It will also allow 
for a standardized training message and a tracking system for all enrolled COVID
-19 
providers.

 COVID
-19 VACCIN
E SAFETY MONITORING 
 An ﬁadverse event following immunizationﬂ is 
a health problem or 
negative 
condition that 
happens after vaccination (i.e., a temporally associated event). It might be truly caused by the 
vaccine or it might be purely coincidental and no
t related to vaccination. CDC continuously 
monitors the safety of vaccines given to children and adults in the United States. VAERS, co
-administered by CDC and FDA, is the national frontline monitoring system for vaccine safety.
 A. Vaccine Adverse Event Repor
ting System 
 Healthcare providers should report clinically important adverse events following COVID
-19 
vaccination to VAERS. VAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety 
problems with vaccines. Anyone
Ša doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or a
ny member of the 
general public
Šcan submit a report to VAERS. VAERS is not designed to detect whether a 
vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify ﬁsignalsﬂ that might indicate possible 

safety problems requiring additional investigation. The main
 goals of VAERS are to: 
  Detect new, unusual, or rare adverse events that happen after vaccination 
  Monitor for increases in known side effects 
  Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of health problems related to 

vaccines 
  Assess the
 safety of newly licensed vaccines 
  Detect unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports 
 Per the CDC COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement, COVID
-19 vaccination 
providers are required to report adverse events following COVID
-19 vaccina
tion and should 
report clinically important adverse events even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused 
the event. Vaccine manufacturers are required to report to VAERS all adverse events that 
come to their attention. VAERS data
-sharing agreements w
ith Department of Defense and 
IHS healthcare facilities are being coordinated through the federal government. Indiana will 
ensure that enrolled COVID
-19 vaccination providers understand the procedures for 
reporting adverse events to VAERS. This information
 will be included in INvest. More 
information on submitting a VAERS report electronically can be found at 
https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html
.   B. Vaccine Safety Datalink 
 The Vaccine Safety Datalink 
(VSD) is a collaboration between CDC™s Immunization Safety 
Office and nine healthcare organizations. This active surveillance system monitors 
electronic health data on vaccination and medical illnesses diagnosed in various healthcare 
settings and conducts 
vaccine safety studies based on questions or concerns raised from 

medical literature and VAERS reports.
 C. Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project 
 CDC™s Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project is a national network of vaccine 

safety experts f
rom CDC™s Immunization Safety Office and seven medical research centers. 
This project conducts clinical research and assesses complex adverse events following

 COVID
-19 VACCINATION PROGRAM MONITORING 
 Continuous monitoring for situational awareness throughout the COVID
-19 vaccination program 
is crucial for a successful outcome. Prior to receiving COVID
-19 vaccine, Indiana has 
established
 procedures for monitoring various critical program planning and im
plementation elements, 
including performance targets, resources, staffing, and activities.
 A. COVID
-19 Vaccination Program Monitoring 
 Vaccine Ordering and Distribution 
Œ Reports can be pulled from both VOMS and VTrckS to 
track the number of doses that have b
een ordered and shipped to COVID
-19 providers by 
PIN # on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to monitor progress on number of doses 
shipped versus number of doses administered. This will allow 
the 
program to determine if 
the IDOH is
 meeting the needs in eac
h county or part of the state based 
on the critical 
population designated by each provider in each phase. 
 B. Resource Monitoring 
 1. Budget and Finance
 The IDOH is tracking the budget based on standard accounting principles set forth in the 
Accounting and Finan
cial Reporting Regulation Manual by the State Board of Accounts 
in PeopleSoft Financial Systems (PeopleSoft). A reconciliation of the funding is done 
monthly based on queries pulled from PeopleSoft.
 2. Staffing
 Having enough adequately trained staff with curr
ent situational awareness is key to 
successful program implementation. Specialized expertise is required, and it is 
important to have backups in each specialty area to guard against interruption of 
activities because of illness or other personal situations
. For example, if staff are 
supporting temporary or off
-site COVID
-19 vaccination clinics, the hours are likely to be 
long and physically taxing. Managers and supervisors need to regularly check in with 

and support assigned staff™s wellness and overall res
ilience to perform the assigned 
tasks.
 3. Supplies
 Important activities during the COVID
-19 vaccination program might be halted if certain 
supplies are depleted without replenishment. Indiana will utiliz
e existing inventory 
management processes monitoring for
 various program components (e.g., 
temporary/off
-site clinics, vaccination provider enrollment and training, vaccine 
management). Regular monitoring of such records will foster early prompts to order and 
replenish supplies and ensure availability as needed
. The 
IDOH will utilizing PPE burn 
rates from testing operations and other response activities and extrapolate this burn rate 
to vaccine activities. Procedures are in place for ordering and procuring additional 
supplies through existing vendors with IDOH.
    Indiana COVID
-19 67 Indiana Department  
 Vaccination Plan
  Of Health
   C. Communication Monitoring
 The 
IDOH
 has created a SmartSheet to track all communication related to the COVID
-19 
vaccine program. The tracking sheet is shared and used within 
OPA,
 listing each 
communication piece, status, distribution method, responsible par
ty, description, deadline, 
status notes and translation to ensure that each communication document is well organized 
and targeted to the intended audience. The sheet also tracks the approval process, 
recipients and completion date to ensure follow through 
and efficiency. This tool has been 
used as our tracking method throughout the response with favorable results.
 The 
IDOH will
 monitor vaccine uptake and monitor social media to gauge the effectiveness 
of the messaging. We will also receive reports on reach 
for social media posts, media 

campaign and any press release and other information Based on that information, we will 
adjust the focus of the communication plan. For example, if we see a lower than expected 
uptake of vaccine among the older population, 
we 
will
 target messaging to those older than 
65 
years
 through a variety of partners, including long
-term care associations, primary care 
providers, Facebook and the Central Indiana Council on Aging and our rural health partners. 
 D. Local Monitoring 
 The Distric
t and Local Readiness section
, within the Division of Emergency Preparedness, 
supports local public health and healthcare preparedness throughout Indiana. This is 

accomplished through Northern, Central, and Southern Regional Managers. Each Regional 
Manager
 oversees the District Public Health Coordinator and District Healthcare Coordinator 
for each respective District.
 This section primarily works with local health departments, 
hospitals, healthcare coalitions, and other public health and healthcare partners
 in each 
District. This preparedness work includes all five mission areas of the National Preparedness 
Goal: Prevention, Protection, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery. Additionally, the District 
and Local Readiness section works closely with several other
 state 
agencies, 
public 
health 
and 
healthcare 
associations, and many other organizations that have local roles in public 
health and healthcare preparedness.
 Throughout the response, 
monitoring
 and outreach efforts 
have occurred with

 Plan
 October 
2021
  1  Introduction
 The Michigan Department of Education (MDE) is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace 
for all workers and customers. To ensure a safe and healthy workplace, 
MDE™s COVID
-19 Preparedness 
Plan and Return to the Office Plan
 were
 developed in respon
se to the COVID
-19 pandemic. Everyone is 
responsible for complying with the requirements and implementing the plan. Our goal is to mitigate the 
potential for transmission of COVID
-19 in our workplace and communities, and that requires full 
cooperation amon
g employees, management, and customers. Only through this cooperative effort can we 
establish and maintain the safety and health of employees and the workplace.
  The 
MDE
 has developed this 
COrona
VIrus 
Disease 20
19 (COVID
-19) Preparedness & Response Plan in 
accordance with the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)
 latest guidance and the 
MIOSHA 
General Duty Clause
, which requires the employer to furnish each employee with ﬁa place of employment 
that is free from recognized hazards
.  The purpose of this plan is to eliminate or minimize potential exposure to and the transmission of COVID
-19 in the workplace.  All employees are responsible for complying with all applicable aspect
s of this plan.  
This written plan is available to all employees via the intranet and upon request.  Questions about this plan 
should be directed to 
Joetta Parker, Human Resources Director, at 
parkerj2@michigan.gov, 
or Amanda 
Satkowski, MDE Safety Coordinator, at 
satkowskia@michigan.gov
.  Exposure Determination
 The 
MDE 
has 
evaluated routine and reasonably anticipated tasks and procedures for all 
employees to determine whether there is actual or reasonably anticipated employee exposure to 

COVID
-19.  The
 MDE 
has determined that all office positions, jobs, or tasks fall into the medium 
or lower (caution) exposure risk levels.  This determination is c
onsistent with the U.S. 
Department of Labor™s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
Hazard 
Recognition/Clarifying Risk of Worker Exposure to COVID
-19.  Medium Exposure Risk
: Jobs that 
require either frequent close contact (within 6 feet for a total of 
15 minutes or more over a 24
-hour period) or sustained close contact with other people in areas 
with community transmission.  
Because any given person may be an asymptomatic carrier, an 
employee™s exposure risk may increase when they have repeated, prolonged contact with other 
people in these situations, particularly where physical distancing and other infection prevention 

measures may not be possible or are not robustly implemented and con
sistently followed.
  Lower 
(caution) 
Exposure Risk
: Jobs that do not require close contact (within 6 feet for a total of 
15 minutes or more over a 24
-hour period) with other people.  Employees in this category have 
minimal occupational contact with the 
public and other coworkers.
   2  Risk Determinations within MDE:
 Positions/Job/Task
 Exposure 
Determination
 Qualifying Factors
 Medium or lower risk jobs include camp 
consultant, resident care aide, resident care 
aide supervisor, special education 
teacher, 
school principal, department manager, 
interpreter, audiology/speech consultant, 
general office assistant, storekeeper, library 
technician, library assistant, librarian, 
library consultant, education field services 
consultant, department analyst, s
tate 
administrative manager, state office 
administrator, superintendent, chief deputy 
superintendent, and deputy superintendent.
 Medium
 or 
Lower
 Jobs that require frequent/close contact 
with people who may be infected, but 
who are not known or suspected pa
tients. 
Workers in this category include those 

who may have contact with the general 
public (e.g., schools, high
-density work 
environments, some
 high
-volume retail 
settings), including individuals returning 
from locations with widespread COVID
-19 transmiss
ion.
  Per the CDC, fully vaccinated employees 
(non
-healthcare workers) likely fall into the 
lower COVID
-19 risk level.
 Lower risk jobs include all office staff 
(majority of the department), consultant, 
secretary, SEMA, manager, analyst, 
technician, specialist, communication 
representative, auditor, state assistant 
administrator, graphic arts designer, 
supervisor, state office administrator, 
student assistant, unclassified, student 
assistant, state worker, buyer.
 Lower
 Jobs that do not req
uire contact with 
people known to be, or suspected of 
being, infected. Workers in this category 
have minimal occupational contact with 
the public and other coworkers.
  Per the CDC, fully vaccinated employees 
(non
-healthcare workers) likely fall into the 
lower COVID
-19 risk level.
  Per the CDC 
Interim Public Health Recommendations/Guiding Principles
, indoor and outdoor activities 
pose a minimal or lower (caution) risk to fully 
vaccinated people.  Additionally, 
fully vaccinated people 
have a reduced risk of transmitting COVID
-19 to unvaccinated people.  In general, employees are 
considered fully vacci
nated:
   2 weeks after their second dose in a 2
-dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or
  2 weeks after a single
-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson™s Janssen vaccine
  Employees who do not meet these requirements are NOT fully vaccinated a
nd are encouraged to keep 
taking all precautions until they are fully vaccinated.
  Engineering Controls
 The MDE 
has implemented feasible engineering controls to minimize or eliminate employee 
exposure to COVID
-19.  Engineering controls involve isolating e
mployees from work
-related 
hazards using ventilation and other engineered solutions (e.g., r
estrict office access, 
situate 
employees 
at least 6™ apart with their computers facing inward and away from cubicle doors or 

aisleways,
 use of high cubicle walls/pa
nels or other barriers, enclosed offices, etc.).
  
Administrative Controls
 Administrative controls are workplace policies, procedures and practices that minimize or 

eliminate employee exposure to the hazard.  
The following administrative controls have been 

established for the
 MDE.
   3  Position/Task
 Administrative Controls
 All 
Employees
 1. Employees are required to self
-monitor for 
COVID
-19 signs and 
symptoms
 prior to leaving for the workplace.
 2. Employees with 
COVID
-19 symptoms
 should stay home and 
contact their supervisor to request appropriate leave approval or lost 
time.
 3. Employees who do not pass the screening 
criteria will be instructed 
to contact their supervisor, not report to work, and may use 
appropriate leave credits or lost time.  Employees who don™t pass the 

screening criteria due to a positive COVID
-19 test or exposure 
should contact their Human Resourc
es Director.
 4. Employees who experience 
COVID
-19 symptoms
 at work should 
notify their supervisor immediately and will not be permitted to stay 
at work.  The Michigan C
ivil Service Commission (MCSC) and 
collective bargaining agreements have leave policies in place that 
promote workers staying at home when they are sick, when 

household members are sick, or when required by a health care 

provider to isolate or quarantine t
hemselves or a member of their 
household.  Eligible employees have access to paid sick and annual 
leave and unpaid medical, and FMLA leaves.
 5. Employees are subject to a health screening consistent with the latest 
guidance from the 
CDC
 upon arrival at the workplace.
 6. Employees are required to promptly report any signs and symptoms 
of COVID
-19 to the Human Resources Director during work to their 
supervisor.
 7. Employees are encouraged to wa
sh or sanitize their hands before 
coming to work, upon entering the building and regularly throughout 
the workday.
 8. Social distancing will be implemented and maintained where 
feasible and efficient.
  Social distancing, also called ﬁphysical 
distancingﬂ, means keeping a safe 
space between yourself and other people who are not from your 
household.  To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet 
away (about 2 arm lengths) from others in indoor spaces when possible.  
Social dista
ncing should be practiced in combination with other 
everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID
-19, including wearing approved face coverings, avoiding the touching your 

face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your hands with 
soap an
d water for at least 20 seconds.
 9. Flexible/alternate work schedules, remote work, o
r a combination of 
remote work/in
-office work may be 
considered on a case
-by-case 
basis.  These options 
are neither a benefit nor an entitlement; they 
are 
subject to agency
 business/operational needs and may be ended 

by the Director or Human Resources Director anytime for any 
reason.
  4  Position/Task
 Administrative Controls
 10. Use of videoconferencing or teleconferencing for meetings and 
gatherings
 will be considered regardless of teleworking or being in 
the office.
 11. Conference rooms and the training room will be arranged to ensure 
appropriate spacing between tables and chairs, attendees etc.
 12. Employees will be encouraged to use break rooms during
 non-busy 
times while maintaining social distancing or use outdoor seating 
areas during lunches, breaks, etc.
 13. Employees who have been exposed to a person with COVID
-19 at 
the workplace and requiring quarantine will be instructed by the 
Human Resources Di
rector as to next steps.  The employee™s health 
status, health information or COVID
-19-related exposure 
information will be kept confidential to the extent possible.
  
Staff 
will be directed to 
contact 
HR director, 
Joetta Parker
, or designee
, if they, a family member, 
or someone 
with whom they live
 tests positive for COVID
-19 so H
R can trace and monitor others 
with whom they have been in close contact while at work.
 The evaluation of a work
-related 
exposure incident, follow
-up, and coordinatio
n of proper cleaning and disinfecting activities will 
be 
coordinated
 by HR.
  
Hand Hygiene and Disinfection of Work Surfaces
 Frequent handwashing is one of the best ways employees can protect themselves from getting 

sick.  To prevent the spread of 
germs during the COVID
-19 pandemic, employees should wash 
their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% 

alcohol to clean hands BEFORE and AFTER:
   Blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
  Entering and lea
ving a public place or work area.
  Preparing or eating food.
  Touching a potentially contaminated surface or object, such as a door handle, table, etc.
  Touching garbage.
  Touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
  Touching your face covering.
  Using the restroom.
  
When the provision of handwashing facilities is not feasible, the 
MDE
 will provide employees 
with antiseptic hand sanitizers or towelettes.
  The virus that causes COVID
-19 can land on work surfaces.  While the risk of infection from 
touc
hing a surface is low, 
regular housekeeping practices have been implemented for the routine 
cleaning and disinfecting of elevators, restrooms, breakrooms, conference/meeting rooms, 

training rooms, doorknobs, and other high touch areas.
  
CDC guidance will b
e followed for special cleaning and disinfecting when someone in the office 

or when someone visited the office has tested positive for COVID
-19.  5   Appropriate and effective cleaning and disinfectant supplies have been purchased and are 

available for use in 
accordance with product labels, safety data sheets and manufacturer 

specifications and are being used with required personal protective equipment for the product.
  Please refer to the
 Department of Technology, Management and Budget/
DTMB Return to Office 
Plan, State Workplace Guidelines
 for any additional cleaning and disinfection criteria.
  Face Coverings and Other Perso
nal Protective Equipment
 The MDE will provide employees with personal protective equipment or clothing (PPE) for the 

protection from COVID
-19 appropriate to the exposure risk associated with the job following the 
CDC and OSHA guidance.  All types of PPE ar
e to be:
   Selected based upon the hazard to the employee.
  Properly fitted and periodically refitted as applicable.
  Consistently and properly worn when required.
  Regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary.
  Properly removed, cleaned, stored,
 or disposed of as applicable to avoid contamination of 

self, others, or the environment.
  
The following type(s) of PPE have been selected for use:
 Positions/job/task
 PPE All 
MDE 
positions
 None currently
  
For the purposes of this plan, a nonmedical cloth face covering is NOT considered PPE.  All 
employees are required to wear a nonmedical cloth face covering while indoors at a state facility, 

in a state vehicle with other passengers, or when required 
MDE
 policy.  Additional face covering 
requirements may apply for work
-related carpool/rideshare or travel.  
Indoors i
ncludes, but is not 
limited to bathrooms, breakrooms/kitchens, conference rooms, corridors at the entrance to a 

building (or waiting to enter a f
acility), cubicles, elevators, hallways, offices, stairwells, training 
rooms, etc.).
  Note
: Some exceptions may apply; exceptions are NOT automatic.  Reasonable 
accommodations may be available to qualified applicants and employees with disabilities.  

Emplo
yees requesting an exception MUST contact the 
Agency ADA Title I Reasonable 
Accommodation Coordinator
 to initiate the reasonable accommodation/disability 
accommodation 
process.
  All 
MDE
 employees will be provided two reusable nonmedical cloth face coverings and basic 
instruction or training on how to wear, maintain, and clean them.
  Employees may provide and use their own masks if they are approved; completely cover the 

mouth, nose, and chin; and are at least as effective as the nonmedical cloth face covering provided 

to all employees.  Face coverings worn in the workplace shall NOT
 be political, offensive or 
contain vulgar, obscene, abusive, or confrontational gestures, language, pictures, websites, etc.  
 6  Face coverings representing certain colleges, universities, sports teams, etc. are permissible 
provided they meet the above
-menti
oned criteria.
  
Face coverings or masks 
that do not completely cover the nose, mouth, or chin, or that 
incorporate
 exhalation valves or vents are not permitted.  Other types of unacceptable face coverings include 

those with large gaps; are too loose or are
 too tight; loosely woven, knitted, or fabrics that let light 
pass through; open
-chin bandanas; scarf/ski mask
-style coverings; single layer coverings; and 
those that are hard to breathe through (e.g., plastic, leather).
  The CDC does NOT recommend the use
 of N95 respirators for the protection against COVID
-19 in office environments, as these respirators 
are critical supplies that should be prioritized for 
healthcare workers and other medical first responders to prevent supply shortages.  
The CDC also 

does not recommend using face shields or goggles as a substitute for face coverings.  If face 

shields are worn, they should be in addition to the face covering.  Face shields should wrap 

around the sides of your face and extend below your chin or be hooded
 (fully enclosed and 

dropping below your chin).
  The 
MDE
 will maintain a sufficient supply of face coverings in the event an employee forgets 
theirs or an employee™s face covering becomes soiled or wet/saturated at work.  Please contact t
he 
Human Resources
 Director or the 
Agency Safety Coordinator
 with any questions.
  Carpool and Rideshares
 The following protective measures are required whenever two or mor
e persons share either a state 
vehicle or personal vehicle for work purposes:
   Stay home when sick.
  Proper wearing of approved face coverings are required in the vehicle regardless of 
vaccination status.
  Limit the number of occupants.  For example, a 
car may allow for a driver plus another 
individual who sits in the rear seat on passenger side of the car. A 12
Œ15-person van might 
accommodate 4
-5 persons (e.g., driver, 1
st row passenger side, 2
nd
 row driver side, 3
rd row 
passenger side, etc.).
  Increase 
the fresh air intake via the vents or by slightly opening the windows.
  Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in the vehicle at the beginning and end of 
each shift, and after an occupant becomes sick.
  Social distance when outside of the vehicle.
  
Travel
 All international business travel must be approved by the Office of the State Employer (OSE).  

Requests are to be submitted through the completion of an 
online form
 and will be considered on 
a case
-by-case basis.  OSE determinations or requests for additional information will be returned 
to the individual submitting the online form.  A separate request m
ust be submitted for each 
employee traveling.
  
To maximize employee protections and potentially prevent the spreading of COVID
-19 to others, 
 7  all persons traveling on behalf of the 
MDE
 will follow the latest CDC guidance for domestic and 
international busin
ess travel.
  All domestic and international business travel should be delayed until employees are fully 

vaccinated.
  Feeling Sick and Sick Employees
 Employees should 
stay home
 and contact their immediate supervisor and healthcare provider if 
they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms, or believe they might have COVID
-19.  Employees 
should contact the Human Resources Director and their immediate supervisor if they, a family 
mem
ber, or someone they live with tests positive for COVID
-19 so they can trace and monitor 
others with whom they have been in close contact while at work.  The evaluation of a work
-related exposure incident, follow up, and coordination of proper cleaning and
 disinfecting 
activities will be conducted by the Human Resources Director, who will follow
-up with building 
management if appropriate.
  Daily Health Screenings/Health Surveillance
 All employees, contractors, interns, or other persons conducting work on behalf of the 
MDE
 will 
be required to participate in daily health screenings upon their return to the workplace.  These 

health screenings are comprised of COVID
-related questions abou
t symptoms and suspected or 
confirmed exposure to people with possible COVID
-19.  
These health screenings can occur through one or more ways (e.g., paper questionnaire, COVID 

screening app using a state
-issued electronic device, 
web
-based questionnaire
 using a personal or 
state
-issued cell phone, or by an employee swiping their employee identification badge/access 
card to enter restricted areas such as parking lots, buildings, rooms, locked storage 
areas, etc.).
  Note
: each time an employee logs onto a state
-provided electronic device or swipes their 
identification/badge to access a secure site or area the person affirms they are symptom
-free and feeling well.
  
Persons exhibiting signs of illness wil
l not be permitted into the building.
  
Close Contacts and When to Quarantine
 Employees who are not fully vaccinated should quarantined if they have been in close contact 
(within 6 feet of someone for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24
-hour 
period) 
with someone who has COVID
-19.  Quarantine is about keeping employees who might have been 
exposed to COVID
-19 away from others.  Report COVID
-19 exposure(s) to the Human 
Resources Director and follow their instructions.
  
Employees who are fully vac
cinated do NOT need to quarantine after contact with someone who 
had COVID
-19 unless they have symptoms.  However, fully vaccinated people should get tested 
3-5 days after their exposure, even if they don™t have symptoms and wear a cloth face covering 
indo
ors in public for 14 days following exposure or until their test result is negative.
   8  Local public health authorities often determine and establish the quarantine options for their 
jurisdictions.  Please contact the Human Resources Director with any questi
ons.
  Training
 All employees, contractors, interns, or other persons conducting work on behalf of the 
MDE
 must 
successfully complete the OSE™s ﬁCOVID
-19: Keeping You Safe at Workﬂ training, which can be 
found out on the 
Civil Service Learning Center
.  This training is in addition to any building
-specific training
 needed to ensure compliance with applicable training requirements and/or 
COVID
-related best practices.  
Training shall minimally include but is not limited to:
   Routes by which the virus cau
sing COVID
-19 is spread.
  Symptoms of a COVID
-19 infection.
  Steps employees must take if they have a 
fever, cough or other symptoms, or believe they 

might have COVID
-19 (e.g., stay home; call their immediate supervisor and healthcare 
provider; notify their 
Human Resources Director if the employee, a family member, or 

someone the employee lives with tests positive for COVID
-19 so the agency can contact 
trace and monitor others with whom the employee had been in close contact while at 

work; etc.).
  The risk of 
a COVID
-19 exposure.
  Measures that the building has taken, and work rules employees must follow to prevent 

exposure (e.g., social distancing, hand hygiene, routine cleaning and disinfection, use of 

cloth face coverings and other personal protective equipme
nt, travel restrictions, daily 
health screenings, close contact and when to quarantine, building signage, etc.).
  Who to contact and what to do if medically unable to wear a cloth face covering.
  Resources available (e.g., Employee Service Program).
  NOTE
:  It is recommended that employee training records minimally contain the 
name(s) of employee(s) trained, date of training, name of trainer and content of 

training.

19
 
(COVID
-
19) Preparedness & Response Plan in accordance with the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's (CDC)
 
latest guidance and the 
MIOSHA General Duty Clause
, which requires the employer to 


 
 
The purpose of this plan is to eliminate or minimize potential exposure to and the transmission of COVID
-
19 in the workplace.  All employees are responsible for complying with all applicable aspects of this plan.  
This written plan is available to a
ll employees via the intranet and upon request.  Questions about this 
plan should be directed to the Human Resources Director or the 
Agency Safety Coordi
nator
.
 
 
Exposure Determination
 
MSHDA 
has evaluated routine and reasonably anticipated tasks and procedures for all employees to 
determine whether there is actual or reasonably anticipated employee exposure to COVID
-
19.  
MSHDA 
has determined that all office
 
positions, jobs, or tasks fall into the medium or lower (caution) exposure risk 

Health Administration (OSHA) 
Hazard Recognition/Clarifying Risk of Worker Exposure to COVID
-
19
.
 
 
Medium Exposure Risk
: Jobs that require either frequent close contact (within 6 feet for a total of 15 
minutes or more over a 24
-
hour period) or sustained close contact with other people in areas with 
community transmission.  
Because any given person may be an asymptomatic ca

exposure risk may increase when they have repeated, prolonged contact with other people in these 
situations, particularly where physical distancing and other infection prevention measures may not be 
possible or are not robustly impleme
nted and consistently followed.
 
 
Lower 
(caution) 
Exposure Risk
: Jobs that do not require close contact (within 6 feet for a total of 15 
minutes or more over a 24
-
hour period) with other people.  Employees in this category have minimal 
occupational contact 
with the public and other coworkers.

Per the CDC 
Interim Public Health Recommendations/Guiding Principles
, indoor and outdoor activities 
pose a minimal or lower (caution) risk to fully vaccinated 
people.  Additionally, fully vaccinated people 
have a reduced risk of transmitting COVID
-
19 to unvaccinated people.  In general, employees are 
considered fully vaccinated:
 
 

 
2 weeks after their second dose in a 2
-
dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna v
accines, or
 

 
2 weeks after a single
-

 
 
Employees who do not meet these requirements are NOT fully vaccinated and are encouraged to keep 
taking all precautions until they are fully vaccinated.
 
 
Engineer
ing 
C
ontrols
 
MSHDA 
has implemented feasible engineering controls to minimize or eliminate employee exposure to 
COVID
-
19.  Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work
-
related hazards using ventilation 
and other engineered solutions (e.g., res

computers facing inward and away from cubicle doors or aisleways, use of high cubicle walls/panels or 
other barriers, enclosed offices, etc.).
 
 
Administrative Controls
 
Administrative contr
ols are workplace policies, procedures, and practices that minimize or eliminate 
employee exposure to the hazard. 
 
The following administrative controls have been established for

Administrative Controls
 
All Employees
 
1.
 
Employees are required to self
-
monitor for 
COVID
-
19 signs and symptoms
 
prior to leaving for the workplace.
 
2.
 
Employees with 
COVID
-
19 symptoms
 
should stay home and contact their 
supervisor to request appropriate leave approval or lost time.
 
3.
 
Employees who do not pass the screening criteria will be instructed to 
contact their 
supervisor, not report to work, and may use appropriate 

due to a positive COVID
-
19 test or exposure should contact their Human 
Resources Director.
 
4.
 
Employees who experience 
COVID
-
19 symptoms
 
at work should notify 
their supervisor immediately and will not be permitted to stay at work.  
The Michigan Civil Service Commission (MCSC) and collective
 
bargaining 
agreements have leave policies in place that promote workers staying at 
home when they are sick, when household members are sick, or when 
required by a health care provider to isolate or quarantine themselves or a 
member of their household.  El
igible employees have access to paid sick 
and annual leave and unpaid medical, and FMLA leaves.
 
5.
 
Employees are subject to a health screening consistent with the latest 
guidance from the 
CDC
 
upon arrival at the workplace.
 
6.
 
Employees are required to promptly report any signs and symptoms of 
COVID
-

The virus that causes COVID
-
19 can land on work surfaces.  While the risk of infection from touching a 
sur
face is low, regular housekeeping practices have been implemented for the routine cleaning and 
disinfecting of elevators, restrooms, breakrooms, conference/meeting rooms, training rooms, doorknobs, 
and other high touch areas.
 
 
CDC guidance will be followed
 
for special cleaning and disinfecting when someone in the office or when 
someone visited the office has tested positive for COVID
-
19.
 
 
Appropriate and effective cleaning and disinfectant supplies have been purchased and are available for 
use in accordance
 
with product labels, safety data sheets and manufacturer specifications and are being 
used with required personal protective equipment for the product.
 
 
Please refer to the Department of Technology, Management and Budget/
DTMB Return to Office Plan, 
State Workplace Guidelines
 
for any additional cleaning and disinfection criteria.
 
 
Face Coverings and Other 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
 
M
SHDA 
will provide employees with personal protective equipment or clothing (PPE) for the protection 
from COVID
-
19 appropriate to the exposure risk associated with the job following the CDC and OSHA 
guidance.  All types of PPE are to be:
 
 

 
Selected based upo
n the hazard to the employee.
 

 
Properly fitted and periodically refitted as applicable.
 

 
Consistently and properly worn when required.
 

 
Regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary.
 

 
Properly removed, cleaned, stored, or disposed of as applicabl
e to avoid contamination of self, 
others, or the environment.
 
 
Positions/job/task
 
PPE
 
All 
MSHDA 
positions
 
None 
beyond appropriate face covering.  
 
(
Additional PPE may be required for 
public
-
facing
 
positions that 
require in
-
person contact with the public, community, visitors, 
contractors
, etc
.  Office Services handles orders of PPE materials 
based on risk assessments completed by each division, 
program.
)
 
 
For the purposes of this plan, a nonmedical cloth face covering is NOT considered PPE.  All employees are 
required to wear a nonmedical cloth face covering while indoors at a state facility, in a state vehicle with 
 MSHDA 
COVID
-

other passengers, or when required by 
MSH
DA
 
policy.  Additional face covering requirements may apply 
for work
-
related carpool/rideshare or travel.  
Indoors includes, but is not limited to bathrooms, 
breakrooms/kitchens, conference rooms, corridors at the entrance to a building (or waiting to ente
r a 
facility), cubicles, elevators, hallways, offices, stairwells, training rooms, etc.).
 
 
Note
: Some exceptions may apply; exceptions are NOT automatic.  Reasonable accommodations may be 
available to qualified applicants and employees with disabilities.  
Employees requesting an exception 
MUST contact the 
Agency ADA Title I Reasona
ble Accommodation Coordinator
 
to initiate the reasonable 
accommodation/disability accommodation process.
 
 
All
 
MSHDA
 
employees will be provided two reusable nonmedical cloth face coverings and basic instruction 
or training on how to wear, maintain, and clean them.
 
 
Employees may provide and use their own masks if they are approved; completely cover the mouth, nose, 
and 
chin; and are at least as effective as the nonmedical cloth face covering provided to all employees.  
Face coverings worn in the workplace shall NOT be political, offensive or contain vulgar, obscene, abusive, 
or confrontational gestures, language, picture
s, websites, etc.  Face coverings representing certain 
colleges, universities, sports teams, etc. are permissible provided they meet the above
-
mentioned criteria.
 
 
Face coverings or masks that do not completely cover the nose, mouth, or chin, or that incor
porate 
exhalation valves or vents are not permitted.  Other types of unacceptable face coverings include those 
with large gaps; are too loose or are too tight; loosely woven, knitted, or fabrics that let light pass through; 
open
-
chin bandanas; scarf/ski ma
sk
-
style coverings; single layer coverings; and those that are hard to 
breathe through (e.g., plastic, leather).
 
 
The CDC does NOT recommend the use of N95 respirators for the protection against COVID
-
19 in office 
environments, as these respirators are cri
tical supplies that should be prioritized for healthcare workers 
and other medical first responders to prevent supply shortages.  The CDC also does not recommend using 
face shields or goggles as a substitute for face coverings.  If face shields are worn, t
hey should be in 
addition to the face covering.  Face shields should wrap around the sides of your face and extend below 
your chin or be hooded (fully enclosed and dropping below your chin).
 
 
MSHDA
 
will maintain a sufficient supply of face coverings in the
 
event an employee forgets theirs or an 

Director or the 
Agency Safety Coordinator
 
with any questions.
 
 
Carpool and Rideshares
 
The following protective measures are required whenever two or more persons share either a state 
vehicle or personal vehicle for work purposes:

nd
 
row driver side, 3
rd
 
row passenger side, etc.).
 

 
Increase the fresh air intake via the vents or by slightly opening the windows.
 

 
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in
 
the vehicle at the beginning and end of each 
shift, and after an occupant becomes sick.
 

 
Social distance when outside of the vehicle.

OSE determinations or requests for additional information will be returned to the individual submitting 
the online form.  A separate request must be 
submitted for each employee traveling.
 
 
To maximize employee protections and potentially prevent the spreading of COVID
-
19 to others, all 
persons traveling on behalf of the 
MSHDA
 
will follow the latest CDC guidance for domestic and 
international business t
ravel.

19.
 
 
These health screenings can occur through one or more ways (e.g., paper questionnaire, COVID screening 
app using a state
-
issued electronic device, 
web
-
based questionnaire
 
using a personal or state
-
issued cell 
phone, or by an employee swiping their employee identification badge/access card to enter restricted 
areas such as parking lots, 
buildings, rooms, locked storage areas, etc.).

19.  Quarantine is about keeping employees who might have been exposed to COVID
-
19 away 
from others.  Report COVID
-
19 exposure(s) to the Human Resources Director and follow their instructi
ons.
 
 
Employees who are fully vaccinated do NOT need to quarantine after contact with someone who had 
COVID
-
19 unless they have symptoms.  However, fully vaccinated people should get tested 3
-
5 days after 

d wear a cloth face covering indoors in public for 14 
days following exposure or until their test result is negative.
 
 
Local public health authorities often determine and establish the quarantine options for their jurisdictions.

 3OVERVIEW
This document has been developed to assist Oklahoma hospitals an
d clinicians during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. As directed 
by 
Gov. Kevin Stitt
, the Oklahoma Hospital Association was tasked with the 
development of a hospital surge plan with support of 
the governor’s COVID-19 Solutions Task Force. The assumptions in
 this document are based on a model created by the Institute of
 Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. 
The Oklahoma statewide plan for a hospital surge of COVID-19 pa
tients is developed using a regional approach to maximize the 
full potential of hospital resources. The plan utilizes the 
existing eight homeland preparedne
ss/trauma regions throughout the 
state to maximize existing working relationships between emergenc
y response and hospitals as well as organize resources by the 
Regional Medical Response System (RMRS) for state and federal al
location of personal protective equipment and other supplies.
The planning process in this plan is organi
zed by a tiered process. Tier 1 is a time
frame when hospital operations are planning
 for an imminent surge of COVID-19 patient. Tier 2 occurs when the ho
spital is seeing a surge of patients and has not moved to a cri
t-ical state but is preparing for st
  ng beyond 100% capacity. Tier 3 is when a hospital is in a surge situation and working beyond 
100% capacity (see de
 nitions on next page). When hospitals begin to reach 
surge capacity of 140%, state government will initiate 
the use of alternative care sites. Tier 4 is when the hospital
 surge has decreased and is normalizing to pre-COVID-19 status.
It is further organized in pillars that include: operations, lo
gistics, clinical care and resources. There are resources for ea
ch tier in these pillars. 
Ideally, this document would have been developed through a deli
berative process involving many stakeholders and reviews. The 
need for established guidance at this critical time necessitat
ed the expedited development of 
a framework for Oklahoma hospi-
tals. However, many hospital CEOs were consulted regarding as
sumptions and surveys that are embedded within this model. 
Many hospitals have a well-developed surge plan and crisis standards process. This document is not intended to prescribe surge 
and crisis planning nor take the place of individual plans. It is meant to help hospitals consider interventions and provide re
sourc-
es for quick reference.
Key De
 nitions 
Conventional capacity
: The spaces, st
 , and supplies used are consistent with da
ily practices within the institution. These 
practices are typically adequate for a major mass casualty incide
nt within the immediate area of the facility, even one that tr
iggers 
activation of the facility 
emergency operations plan.
Contingency capacity
: The spaces, st
 , and supplies used are not consistent with 
daily practices, but provide care to a stan-
dard that is functionally equivalent to usual patient care prac
tices. These practices may be us
ed temporarily during a major ma
ss casualty incident or on a more sustained basis during a disaster that puts strain on the system or region (when the demands of 
the 
incident exceed community resources).
Crisis capacity
: Adaptive spaces, st
 , and supplies are not consistent with usual standards of care, but provide su
  ciency of 
care in the setting of a catastrophic disaster (i.e. provide the 
best possible care to patients
 given the circumstances and res
ources 
available). Crisis capacity activation constitutes a signi
 cant adjustment to standards of care and typically occurs with a national or 
global event such as the COVID-19 response.
EMResource®
: A web-based information and resource management tool th
at has been adapted to collect real-time data on hos-
pital capacity and capability, and includes ventilator, PPE
 and other resources for Oklahoma’s COVID-19 response. 
 4Duty to Plan
Hospitals must develop plans for moving from Tier 1 to Tier 3. Duri
ng a disaster or declared emergency, the goal is to remain i
n Tier 1 status to the extent possible and avoid moving to Tier
 3.  Strategies for remaining in the lower tiers may include:
† Canceling elective procedures an
d surgeries to increase capacity.
† Early discharge or transfer of appropriate patients to home or less acute levels of care.
† Transferring less acute patients from medical surgical units to 
alternate care sites, with the assistance of case managers and 
discharge planners.
† Transferring post-acute and behavioral health patien
ts from acute settings into
 other appropriate settings.
† Expanding critical care capacity into areas such as post-ane
sthesia care units, surgical suites, outpatient care units.
† Expanding patient care areas to in
clude hallways and private rooms.
† Expediting admissions to move patients from the emergency department to patient care units.
† EMTALA compliant screening of in
dividuals seeking care, in coordination with 
EMS or other medical direction, to determine 
the most appropriate setting for care including an esta
blished alternate care site for less acute patients.
MERC
: During a response, the regional MERC (Medical Emergency 
Response Center), operating under the direction of the Re-
gional Medical Response System, is designed to operate as a mult
i-agency coordination center th
at represents the greater health
 care community. Their role includes promot
ing and facilitating the shar
ing of incident and response information and resources 
between health care organizations, and coordinating support th
rough an established and operational interface between health 
care organizations and the relevant jurisdictional agency(ies).
TReC
: Trauma Transfer and Referral Center. Initially, TReC was es
tablished as a communication center for ambulance services 
transporting pre-hospital patients or transferring patients inte
r-facility whereby TReC must be contacted for transfer within m
et-
ropolitan areas. For the COVID-19 response, TReC will become the center for requested transfers.    
Surge
: Ability to provide adequate medical evaluation and care during
 events that exceed the limits of the normal medical infra-
struct
 ected community. In the Ok
 nition of surge is 40% over 100% capacity of normal. 
Level of Surge Descriptions
Tier 1
: The surge of patients is such that the hospital mobilizes it
s existing on-site human and materiel resources. The hospital 
begins strategies to plan for additional patients and conserves resources. 
Tier 2
: The surge of patients is such that the hospital needs to cons
ider the deployment of additional human and materiel resourc-
es without changing the traditional standard of care, to prepar
e for 100% capacity. The trigger for this consideration is a 60%
 occupancy of normally st
 ed beds, increasing cases in the community and 
continued admissions. Incident Command may be 
activated and normal operations may be
 ected, e.g., cancellation of elective admissions and procedures, and conservation of 
resources. 
Tier 3
: The surge of patients is such that the traditional standard of care may be
 ected due to limited resources at the hospital 
and the inability of the hospital
 to transfer patients to other hospitals. The 
hospital conserves resources and may use the Cri
sis 
Standards of Care to assist in making conservati
on decisions. Normal operations may be si
 cantly a
 ected. The use of alternate 
care sites may be considered. 
Tier 4
: The hospital surge has decreased and is normalizing to pre-COVID-19 status.
 5Planning Assumptions
Planning assumptions spec
 c for the COVID-19 pande
mic include the following:
† Adjusted sta
  ng ratios and roles will be needed to extend and maximize care.
† Sta
  availability will be reduced due to COVID-19 exposure and 
illness, quarantine, exhaustion and personal decisions to not 
report for duty.
† There could be insu
  cient beds for all patients needing 
inpatient and especially critical care.
† There could be insu
  cient personal protective equipment for health care workers.
† The majority of infected patients can be treated at less acute levels of care or at home.
† The number of patients requiring hospital care could 
exceed the current capacity of Oklahoma hospitals. 
Oklahoma COVID-19 Plan for 
Patient Care Settings 
Overview: Planning and Preparing for Surge in Hospitals
Under the direction of the governor’s COVID-19 Task Force and in
 partnership with the Oklahoma Hospital Association, Oklahoma 
State Department of Health, and the Oklahoma National Guard, a su
rge plan for the state of Oklaho
ma was created that includes 
the current health care system and alternate care sites. Planning
 includes surge over 40% capacity, the evaluation of current r
e-sources, and adaptation of the current regi
onal infrastructure to address COVID-19.  
Oklahoma Regional Infrastructure
There are three components of current regional infrastructure that have been adapted for the COVID-19 response: eight geo-
graphic preparedness regions, EMResource, and 
TReC (Trauma Transfer and Referral Center).
Oklahoma™s Eight Geographic Preparedness Regions
Oklahoma is divided into eight geographic regions utilized by the Oklahoma O
  ce of Homeland Security and the Oklahoma State 
Department of Health for the purpose of planning, protecting, pr
oviding funding and responding to 
an incident. Hospital capaci-
ty and capability was evaluated to determine resources available 
to care for the COVID-19 patient at the closest, most appropri
ate 
hospital with the resources available to care for the patient. Re
gion 1 is NW Oklahoma, Region 2 is NE, Region 3 is SE, Region 
4 is 
East-Central, Region 5 is SE, Region 6 surrounds Oklahoma County, Region 7 is Tulsa County, and Region 8 is Oklahoma County 

(see maps, next page). The Oklahoma Hospital Association conducte
d an assessment of current ventilator resources in each region
 and compiled the information 
contained in the surge plan.
 6Current Infrastructure: 
8 Preparedness Regions
Trauma Regions and Hospitals 
by Trauma Level
Oklahoma 2019
In the following regional information:
† Hospital resource data was obtained through an OHA survey.
† Total vents: Number of full feature ventilators (including 
BiPap and anesthesia machines) 
immediately available for use.
 7 8 9EMResource  
In Oklahoma, EMResource has been used fo
r 20 years to coordinate and communicate 
capacity and resources by hospitals and 
emergency medical services. EMResource is a web-based informat
ion and resource management tool that has been adapted to 
collect real-time data on hospital and EMS capacity and capabi
lity, including ventilator, PPE and other resources for Oklahoma’
s COVID-19 response. Daily queries and updating of current informat
ion provide the most accurate source of information for oper-
ational decision making. All Oklahoma acute 
care hospitals and EMS agencies have access to entering data into EMResource. This 
daily data reported to EMResource by hospit
als is the basis for PPE/resource allocation.
TReC- Trauma Transfer and Referral Center
The Trauma Transfer and Referral Center (TReC) was established by statute OS §63-1-2530.8.  – Rule: OS 310:641-3-130 to ensure 
trauma patients go to the closest, most 
appropriate hospital, reduce over and under-
triage, preserve resources for those that n
eed 
them the most, and to help limi
t demand on scarce specialists.
The TReC has been adapted to the COVID-19 response to transpor
t/transfer COVID (+) patients to the closest, most appropriate 
facility within their region if capacity/capability exists and fa
cilitate referral of COVID (+) patients requiring a higher lev
el of care to 
the closest, most appropriate facility.
Surge Plan
Introduction
A tiered action plan for surge was created to
 ne “trigger points,” based upon hospital capacity for implementation of actions 
to maximize resources. This action plan is not intended to repl
ace surge plans prepared by individual hospitals, but acts as a 
guide 
for hospitals. Th
 ned Tiered Action Plan Triggers provides an overal
l statewide view of hospital capacity and capability.
For the Oklahoma Hospital Surge Plan, go to 
https://bit.ly/3breKRX
. 10The Oklahoma Hospital Surge Plan is divided 
into four “pillars” with components relative to 

the COVID-19 response.  Each component has 

been assessed and resources developed for 

statewide planning and 
for hospital use.  
Operations: 
addresses st
  ng, ICU and med-
surg beds, alternative care models;

Logistics: 
addresses facilities, transportation, 
health care worker wellness;

Clinical Care: 
guidelines for provision of care, 
referral to a higher level of care, EMS medical 

direction, telemedicine;

Resources
: human, supply chain and equipment 
items required to implement surge plan.

. 14Telemedicine
Overview
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and SoonerCa
re, along with most commercial payors, have relaxed and/or 
waived many restrictions around provision 
of telemedicine services for the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine services are highly 
recommended in cases where patients are medi
cally stable and able to quarantine in 
their home setting. Telemedicine services 
are also recommended for all other patients to promote decreased
 exposure, particularly for those in the at-risk category. Tele
-medicine may be provided through tele-monit
oring, virtual visit, e-visit or by phone,
 all with varying options for the type of 
med-
ical care allowed. Patients must consent verbally to telemedicine
 services and this must be documented in the patient’s medical
 record. Patients and family members should receive guidance an
d education on telemedicine opti
ons and how to use the chosen 
option. For further guidance on Oklahoma issues from reimbursem
ent to licensure on telemedicine, please see the OHA overview 
document, “Telehealth in Oklahoma During COVID-19,” 
https://bit.ly/2RCl3dM
. A problem iden
 ed early in the Oklahoma hospital su
rge planning process was the need for 
specialists or assistance of intensiv-
ists due to possible fatigue during the COVID-19 pa
ndemic in rural or critical access hospital
  liated with hospital systems. 
Deployment of telemedicine to hospitals with the need for equi
pment will keep patients in their communities and keep all pos-
sible COVID patients in a stable acute env
ironment without transport to an urban cent
er, while transportation and PPE are scarc
e statewide during the pandemic. 
Breadth of problemOklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences (OSUCHS) 
administers the federal FLEX and SHIP grants for 54 rural hospi-
tals, and through the OSU Center for Rural Health has been suppor
ting these hospitals as they pr
epare and update their Incident
 Command Center protocols and community readiness for the COVID-
19 pandemic. The center believes there would be interest 
Decontamination and Reuse of Filtering Facepiece Respirators using Contingency and Crisis Capacity Strategies
 – Dispos-
ab
 ltering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are not approved for rout
ine decontamination and reuse as standard of care. However, 
FFR decontamination and reuse may need to be considered as a crisis capacity strategy to ensure continued availability. This do
c-ument summarizes research about decontamination 
of FFRs before reuse. To learn more, go to

ents for some level of telemedicine assistance, and a consid-
erable number of these hospitals are not part
 of a larger integrated hospital system. OHA, as part of a survey conducted in Apr
il 2020, further iden
 ed hospitals that desired and needed telemedicine equipment and support. 
Primary solution
The OSU Telehealth Solutions was iden
 ed as a turnkey solution for the hospital su
rge to provide physician encounters and tele-
health carts for the pandemic. The Oklahoma O
  ce of Rural Health is working to help support the preparedness initiatives of the 
state’s COVID-19 Task Force. The state is acquiring telemedicine
 carts for rural providers that 
can provide real-time physician
 sup-
port to rural medical communities anticipating needs for additi
onal ICU intensivists, internists, pulmonologists, or other resp
ira-
tory support to hospital medical st
 . This
 ort will help provide rural hospitals addi
tional physician manpower, or help provide 
evening or weekend relief to existing physicians and provider co
mmunity. The telehealth solution carts will be powered by OSU 
TeleHealth Solution, a physician-led initiative within OSU Medicine, and will have board-cer
 ed, Oklahoma licensed physicians 
available via telemedicine consultation. The OSU Telehealth Solutions is st
 ed by OSU faculty or adjuncts. These physicians are 
all board cert
 ed in their specialty, licensed in Oklahoma 
and accountable to OSU as part of the faculty.

 16Cart Distribution and Service Orientation  
The cart is very user friendly and only requires a basic Wi-Fi 
or hardline internet connection. 
Technology delivery schedule an
d coordination of cart set up will need to occur with each site
. Upon completion of set up, on-boarding and orientation sessions 
will 
need to occur for all clinical st
  at each site. Training can be done regionally 
through ECHO or regular zoom meetings with the 
hospital st
 . This can be organized virtually in two-hour blocks up 
to three times per week. For example, OSU TeleHealth Solu-
tions has the capacity to on-board up to six sites per two-hour block (8 -10 a.m., 10 a.m.-12 p.m., 1-3 p.m., and 3-5 p.m.) Mon
day, 
Wednesday and Friday. Participating sites can attend as many or
ientation sessions as needed though typically do not require 
more than six to eight hours of orientation. IT support remains available to each site after go-live on a 24/7/365 basis.  
Acquisition costs for the telemedicine cart will be covered by 
COVID-19 response stimulus funding to OSU. Additionally
 rst 90 
days of hospitalist medicine service will be covered through the 
same funding pool. Upon completion of the introductory 90-day 
period, the hospital may continue the hospitalist service for a mo
nthly investment of $9,000, or they may exit the program with
-out an
 nancial obligation. Supplemental funding may also be avai
lable to cover the service th
rough grant funding and avail-
able programs such as SHIP, FLEX, and other federally issued prog
rams designed to provide assistance to critical access hospita
l markets. The State O
  ce of Rural Health in coordination with the OSU Ce
nter for Rural Health are ex
ploring these and additional funding programs to
 set or defray ongoing costs of the service outside of the introductory period.
Mental Health and Telemedicine 
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse 
Services has procured an option for providers – Polycom Real 
Presence. The initiation fees associated wi
th their utilization will be waived. For in
formation on using this tool, contact the
 ODMHSAS Help Desk, (405) 248-9326. All services using a recognized
 telehealth platform are considered face-to-face. Those will 
now include group and family therapy services. There is nothing 
prohibiting treatment providers from engaging with consumers 
over the telephone. A list of reimbursable service codes can be accessed at 
https://bit.ly/3cft7ZH
. These codes are for department 
contracted services paid for by ODMHSAS.
Telephone Codes Reimbursable Through OHCA
 ective immediately and only for as long as the national em
ergency surrounding COVID-19 exists, services rendered by behav-
ioral health providers via telephone will use the HCPCS/CPT codes 
listed in the rates and codes sh
eets applicable to their prov
ider type found at 
https://bit.ly/3cfSfPU
, using the GT mo
 er. Services should only be delivered telephonically (not face-to-face) in 
instances when the SoonerCare member does not have access to 
telehealth equipment, the service is necessary to the health 
and safety of the member, and the service can sa
 ectively be provided over the telephone. Providers are encouraged 
to create internal policies and procedures regarding the use of 
telehealth during a national/state emergency so all of the st
  un-
derstand its appropriate use during this time. Documentation in th
e client’s record should either reference the provider’s inte
rnal 
policy or otherwise indicate why telehealth was utilized if th
e service was not reimbursed via telehealth prior to March 16, 20
20.
Mental Health and Substance Abuse
The Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is 
taking action to help those feeling depressed, while at home 
during the coronavirus pandemic. Starting April 10, every city-cou
nty health department in the state was equipped with an iPad.
 Someone walking in needing help can use th
e iPad to speak with a mental health professional. The person can take the iPad 
home with them to continue conversations with the provider. “There
’s a button on it. They hit the button and it links up to com
-munity mental health providers in their area. Someone is
 able to talk with them and work through it,” said 
Carrie Slatton-Hodges
, the interim commissioner for the Oklahoma Department of Mental
 Health and Substance Abuse Services. Eighty-one sites across 
the state have the iPads. Because of the state’s large presence 
of telehealth technology, Slatton-Hodges said the department ha
s been able to continue performing 90% of services.

Scarce Resource Management and 
Crisis Standards of Care
Introduction
In the event of a large-scale disaster, either a no-notice event such as a natural disaster or a prolonged situation such as a 
pan-
demic, there is the potential for an overwhelming number of cr
itically ill or injured patients. In these situations, certain me
dical 
resources may become scarce and prioritization of care may need to be considered.
A medical surge is a complex multi-system event, th
e response to which is equally complex.
 ort to better understand, 
measure, discuss best practices and manage medical surge,
 it is essential to have an overall guiding framework.
In 2009, the Institute of Medicine publishe
d a landmark report, in which the author
 ned Crisis Standards of Care as follows:
This report de
 nes crisis standards of care and sets forth a vision for a system of just care in catastrophic events that includes 
fairness; equitable processes; community an
d provider engagement, education, and co
mmunication; and the rule of law. It 
also concludes that “there is an urgent and clear need for a single national guidance for states for crisis standards of care t
hat 
can be generalized to all crisis events.”  The authors outlined a framework for the discussion of surge capacity de
 ning it as a 
continuum from conventional to contingency,
 nally crisis. They de
 ned this “Continuum of Care” as follows:  
† Conventional capacity -
the spaces, st
 , and supplies used are consistent with da
ily practices within the institution. These 
spaces and practices are used during a major mass casualty in
cident that triggers activation of the facility emergency 
operations plan.
ﬁA substantial change in usual healthcare operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, which is made neces-

sary by a pervasive (e.g. pandemic in uenza) or catastrophic (e.g. earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the 

level of care delivered is just ed by spec c circumstances and is formally declared by a state government in recogni-

tion that crisis operations will be
 ect for a sustained period. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care 
are in operation enables spec c legal/regulatory power and protections for healthcare providers in the necessary task 

of allocating and using scarce medical resources and implementing alternate care facility operations.” 
 18† Contingency capacity -
 the spaces, st
 , and supplies used are not consistent wi
th daily practices but provide care that 
is functionally equivalent to usual patient care. These spaces
 or practices may be used temporarily during a major mass 
casualty incident or on a more sustained basis during a di
saster (when the demands of the incident exceed community 
resources).
† Crisis capacity -
 adaptive spaces, st
 , and supplies are not consistent with usual standards of care but provide su
  ciency 
of care in the context of a catastrophic disaster (i.e., provid
e the best possible care to pati
ents given the circumstances and
 resources available). Crisis capacity activation constitutes a signi
 cant adjustment to standards of care.  
These sa nitions are used elsewhere in this Oklahoma Hospital Surge Plan and Hospital Planning Toolkit. 
The National Academy of Medicine also stresses the importance 
of an ethically grounded system to guide decision making in 
crisis to ensure the most appropriate use of resources. They de
 ne these ethical principles as:
† Fairness 
– standards that are, to the highest degree 
possible, recognized as fair by
 ected by them – including 
the member
 ected communities, practitioners, and provider orga
nizations, evidence-based and responsive to specif-
ic needs of individual
s and the population.
† Duty to care
 – standards are focused on the duty of health care prof
essionals to care for patients in need of medical care.
† Duty to steward resources
 – health care institutions
  cials have a duty to steward scarce resources, 
re
 ecting the utilitarian goal of saving 
the greatest possible number of lives.
† Transparency
 – in design and decision making.
† Consistency
 – in application across populations 
and among individuals regardless of 
their human condition (e.g. race, age 
disability, ethnicity, ability to pay, socioeconomic status, pree
xisting health conditions, social
 worth, perceived obstacles t
o treatment, pass use of resources).
† Proportionality
 – public and individual requirements must be commen
surate with the scale of the emergency and degree 
of scarce resources.
† Accountability
 – in individual decisions and implementation stand
ards, and of governments fo
r ensuring appropriate pro-
tections and just allocation of available resources.
Oklahoma Model Crisis Standards of Care
The Oklahoma State Department of Health publishe
 nal version on April 10, 2020, of “Hospital Crisis Standards of Care: 
Resource Reference Cards.”  This model for allocation of scar
ce resources is based on a decade of research and community 
engagement by the authors and spec
 cally was developed to provide practical an
d clear guidance for clinicians during a 
disaster or pandemic. It combines clinical assessment tools and 
predictive measures to score al
l critically ill patients, regar
dless 
of whether their condition was caus
ed by the disaster or pandemic.
The document iden
 es core clinical strategies for scarce resource situatio
ns and acts as a decision support tool. It is designed 
to facilitate a structures approach to resource shortfalls at a 
health care facility. It assumes an incident management is impl
e-mented and that key personnel are familiar with ethical 
frameworks and processes that underline these decisions.
Each facility will have to determine the most
 appropriate steps to take to address spec
 c shortages. It is advised key st
  of 
each facility become familiar with this card set to aid with 
event preparedness and in anticipation of coping mechanisms to 
each core category situation outlined in the cards.
Each core category has a resource reference card that includes
 practices and resources that form the basis for medical and 
critical care. The cards exam
ine the demands of a spec
 c subset of patients or a spec
 c resource likely to require specialized 
responses during a major incident. These cards may contain content spec
 c to the state of Oklahoma that may not be applica-
ble in other areas due to
 erences in resource availability or vulnerability.
 19Further, during an incident, the Oklahoma State Department of He
alth (OSDH) may update or change this guidance document.   
Scarce resource cards have been created in the OSDH “Hospital Crisis Standards of Care: Resource Reference Cards,”

Waivers
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Kevin Stitt issued several executive orders. In addition, the governor invoked for t
he  rst time in state history the Catastrophic Emergency Health Powers Act that gave him adde
 exibilities during this time. 
In certain circumstances, the Secretary of the Department of Heal
th and Human Services (HHS), using section 1135 of the Social 
Security Act (SSA), can temporarily modify or waive certain Medi
care, Medicaid, CHIP, or HIPAA requirements, called 1135 waiver
s. 
Th
 erent kinds of 1135 waivers, including Medicare blanket 
waivers. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority and the Okla-
homa Hospital Association submitted and received approval for several waivers.

Pacific College of Health and Science has developed a written COVID
-
19 Preparedness and Response 
 
in order to equip employees with the information, guidance, and directives to protect the
mselves and others. 
This plan is a living document 
that will be updated and edited as 
local, state and federal agencies provide new 
guidance
.
 
 
This plan focuses
 
on the need for certain control measures
,
 
including engineering, administrative, personal 
protective equipment, and safe work practices as well as staff training. All employees should use this protocol 
to determine appropriate actions for their place of work.
 
 
The
 
purpose is to reduce the impact 
of 
COVID

19 outbreak conditions in our facilities. This plan 
is to be used in conjunction with the Pacific College
 
Health and Safety Manual
 
and the policies 
referred to within in document.

pandemic affecting many 
countries globally.
 
 
Sources of COVID

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person
-
to
-
person, including:
 

 
Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
 

 
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person 
coughs, sneezes
,
 
or speaks.
 

 
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or 
possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
 

 
Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been 
reports of this type of asymptomatic transmission with this new 
coronavirus, but

this is also not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

Currently, there is no evidence to support

preparing or eating food
,
 
it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 
seconds 
for general
 
food safety. 
Throughout the
 
day
,
 
use a tissue 
to cover your
 
coughing or sneezing, and 
wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

that has the virus on it and
 
then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not 
thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
 
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely 
a 
very low risk of 
spread from food pr
oducts or packaging.
 
Wash fruits and vegetables the same way you should do under any circumstance: before handling them, 
wash your hands with soap and water. Then, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, 
especially if you eat them raw.

Infection Prevention and Control Measures
 
Infection control is a 
system 
of 
measures practiced 
by 
employers 
to 
prevent 
the transmission 
of 
infectious agents 
(e.g., 
bacteria, viruses). Infection control 
strategies are 
designed 
to 
prevent 
infections and injuries and 
illnesses 
in personnel.
 
Workplace Controls
 

controlling workplace hazards. The bel
ow graphic lists the different potential 
control mechanisms.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
PacificCollege.ed
u

Elimination
 
 
Physically removing the hazard is the most effective hazard control. For example, if employees 
must work high above the ground, the hazard can be eliminated by moving the 
piece they are 
working on to ground level to eliminate the need to work at heights.
 
 
 
 
Section I: Reference Materials: 
Substitution
 
 
Substitution, the second most effective hazard control, involves replacing something that 
produces a hazard 
(similar to elimination) with something that does not produce a hazard

for 
example, replacing lead
-
based paint with titanium white. To be an effective control, the new 
product must not produce another hazard.
 
 
 
Engineering Controls
 
 
Engineering controls are favored over administrative and personal protective equipment (PPE) 
for controlling existing worker exposures in the workplace because they are designed to 
remove the hazard at the source before it comes in contact with the worker.
 
Well
-
designed 
engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be 
independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The initial cost of 
 
With an outbreak, it 

always practical
 
to 
eliminate or substitute a 
hazard. 
 
So
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
protection
 
measures
 
(from
 
most
 
effective
 
to 
least
 
effective)
 
are
 
engineering
 
controls,
 
administrative
 
controls
 
and
 
then personal 
protective 
equipment or
 
PPE.

engineering controls can be higher than the cost of adm
inistrative controls or PPE, but over the 
longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide cost 
savings in other areas of the process.
 
 
Administrative Controls
 
 
Administrative controls include changes to work policy and
 
procedures as well as safe work 
practices that are designed to reduce or minimize the duration, intensity, and frequency of 
exposure to a hazard. This methodology requires 
a 
conscious worker effort to employ.
 
 
Personal Protective Equipment
 
 
While using PP
E correctly can prevent some exposures, it should not be used without the other 

-
 

equipment used must suit the job function being performed. While PPE determination 
is made 
by the employer, OSHA and the CDC have issued guidance on recommended PPE for the 
COVID

gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash. 
 
 

 
Gloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used. 
 

 
Additional
 
PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being 
used and whether there is a risk of splash.
 

 
Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer 
and the surrounding area. Be sure to perform hand hygiene per the Hand Hygiene Policy 
after gloves are removed. 
 

 
If gowns are not available, coveralls, aprons
,
 
or work uniforms can be worn during 
cleaning and disinfecting. Reusable (washable) clothing should be laundered afterwards. 
Clean hands after handling dirty laundry. 
 

 
Gloves should be removed after cleaning a room or area occupied by ill persons. Be sure 
to perform hand hygiene per the Hand Hygiene Policy after gloves are removed.

Employees whose job duties do not require PPE (e.g. administrative staff) are permitted to 
wear cloth face coverings.
 

Employees engaged in direct patient care activities are permitted to wear cloth face 
coverings when NOT performing such 
activities.
 
 

Employees are instructed that if they touch or adjust their facemask

Section II: Protocols: 
HAND HYGIENE 
 
 
One of the best ways to inhibit the 
spread of SARS
-
COV
-
2 is frequent and thorough 
handwashing. This protocol details the process for proper handwashing, appropriate products 
for hand hygiene
,
 
and how/when to use them.
 
Refer to
 
Hand Hygiene Policy
 
 
General guidance for all
 
 
What is hand hygie
ne?
 
 
Hand Hygiene means cleaning your hands by using either handwashing (washing hands with 
soap and water), antiseptic handwash, antiseptic hand rub (i.e.
,
 
alcohol
-
based hand sanitizer 
including foam or gel), or surgical hand antisepsis.
 
 
Why practice han
d hygiene?
 
 
Cleaning your hands reduces:
 

 
The spread of potentially deadly germs to patients
 

 
Colonization or infection caused by germs acquired from the others and the 
environment
 
 
Methods to maintain hand skin health
 

 
Lotions and creams can prevent and decr
ease skin dryness that happens from cleaning 
your hands
 
 
Factors in choosing hand hygiene products
 
   
 
 
 
 
PacificCollege.ed
u

Hand washing methodology
 
1.
 
Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply 
soap.
 
2.
 
Lather your hands by rubbing them togethe
r with the soap. Lather the backs of your 
hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
 
3.
 

from beginning to end twice.
 
4.
 
Rinse your hands well under clean, 
running water.
 
5.
 
Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.
 
 

 
Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If 
soap and water are not readily 
available, you can use an alcohol
-
based hand sanitizer that 
contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by 
looking at the product label.
 
Section II: Protocols:
 
 
Sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germ
s on hands in many situations. 
 
However,
 

 
Sanitizers do not get rid of all types of germs.
 

 
Hand sanitizers may not be as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy.
 

 
Hand sanitizers might not remove harmful chemicals from hands like pesticides and 
heav
y metals.
 
 
How to use hand sanitizer
 
1.
 
Apply the gel product to the palm of one hand (read the label to learn the correct 
amount).
 
2.
 
Rub your hands together.
 
3.
 
Rub the gel over all the surfaces of your hands and fingers until your hands are dry. This 
should take
 
around 20 seconds.
 
 
Caution! 
Swallowing alcohol

Fingernail care and jewelry
 

 
Germs can 
live under artificial fingernails both before and after using an
 
alcohol

hand sanitizer and handwashing
 

 
It is recommended that healthcare providers do not wear artificial fingernails or 
extensions when having direct contact with patients at high risk
 
(e.g., those in intensive
-
care units or operating rooms)
 

 
Keep natural nail tips less than ¼ inch long

Instruct patients and visitors that if they touch/adjust their face covering, they should 
perform hand hygiene immediately before and after.
 
 

Patients may remove their face covering when in their rooms but 
should put them back on 
when leaving their room or when others (e.g., HCP, visitors) enter the room.

General guidance for all
 
 
Transmission of SARS

CoV
-
2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus a possible 
source of transmission. Transmission of coronavirus
, in g
eneral,
 
occurs much more commonly 
through respiratory droplets than through fomites (objects or materials which are likely to 
carry infection, such as clothes, utensils, and furniture). Current evidence suggests that SARS
-
CoV
-
2 may remain viable for hours 
to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. 
Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for 
the 
prevention of COVID
-
19 and other viral respiratory illnesses.
 
   
 
 
 
 
PacificCollege.ed

Cleaning
 
refers to the removal of dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. 
Cleaning alone does not kill germs. But by removing the germs, it decreases their number 
and
,
 
therefore
,
 
any risk of spreading infection.
 
Disinfecting
 
works by using chemicals, 
for example
,
 
EPA
-
registered disinfectants, to kill germs 
on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But 
killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduces any risk of spreading 
infection.
 
Pacific C
ollege janitorial service providers have implemented enhanced cleaning and 
disinfection procedures to meet the recommended CDC guidelines. The janitorial service 
providers use EPA registered disinfectants listed for use against SARS

Low 
Exposure Risk
 
Routine environmental cleaning and disinfection
 
Routinely clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as 
workstations, keyboards, telephones, handrails, and doorknobs.
 
If surfaces are dirty, they should be clean
ed using a detergent or soap and water prior to 
disinfection.

aerosolized droplets from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection and are a key 
component to the Aerosol Transmissible Disease Control Plan and the Bloodborne Pathogen 
Exposure Control Plan. St
andard Precautions are used for the protection and care of all staff, 
students and patients. Standard Precautions apply to (1) aerosolized droplets (2) blood; (3) all 
body substances, secretions, and excretions (except sweat), regardless of whether or not 
the 
substances contain visible blood; (4) non

1.
 
Hand Hygiene General Hand hygiene: Hands should be washed with soap and 
water for 
at least 20 seconds when visibly soiled, before eating, and after using the restroom or more 
frequently to effectively prevent the spread of pathogens and infections. Hand hygiene in a 
healthcare setting occurs after touching blood, body substanc
es, respiratory secretions, 
excretions and contaminated items, whether or not gloves are worn. Perform hand hygiene 
between patient contacts and when otherwise indicated to avoid transfer of microorganisms to 
other patients or the environment. Soap, and at
 
minimum 60% alcohol
-
based hand sanitizer is 
used for routine hand hygiene.

2.
 
Gloves are worn when routinely cleaning and disinfecting environmental surfaces. 
Gloves are worn for medical screenings, touching blood, body substances, respiratory 
secretions, excretions, and contaminated items. Gloves are used when touc
hing mucous 
membranes and non
-
intact skin. Gloves should also be worn when the touching of such 
substances and items can be reasonably anticipated. Remove gloves promptly after use before 
touching non
-
contaminated items and environmental surfaces and befor
e caring for another 
patient. Hand hygiene is performed immediately after removing gloves.
 
3.
 
Masks, Protective Eyewear, and/or Fluidshields are worn to protect the mucous 
membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth during procedures and patient care activities 
that are 
likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body substances, secretions or excretions.
 
4.
 
Gowns are used to protect skin and to prevent soiling of clothing during procedures and 
patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes or s
prays of blood, body substances, 
respiratory secretions, excretions, pathogens or droplets. The gown is removed as promptly as 
possible and hand hygiene is performed to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients 
or the environment.
 
5.
 
Patient Care 
Equipment soiled with blood, body substances, respiratory secretions, 
excretions, pathogens or droplets. is handled in a manner that prevents skin and mucous 
membrane exposures, contamination of clothing and the transfer of microorganisms to other 
patients
 
or the environment. Reusable equipment is not used on another patient until the 
equipment has been cleaned and reprocessed appropriately. Single use items are discarded 
properly.
 
6.
 
Environmental Surfaces workstations, office equipment, treatment tables t
reatment 
room equipment, and other frequently touched surfaces are maintained, cleaned and 
disinfected according to CDC guidelines and EPS standards and products for cleaning and 
disinfection. A log of daily facility cleaning and disinfection and frequent 
restroom and 
treatment room cleaning and disinfection must be maintained.
 
7.
 
Linen During the COVID
-
19 pandemic linens will be assumed to be soiled after each 
patient treatment and will be handled as if soiled with pathogens and droplets. Linen soiled 
with
 
blood, body substances, respiratory secretions, excretions, pathogens and droplets is 
handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents skin and mucous membrane 
exposures and contamination of clothing and that avoids the transfer of microorgani
sms to 
other patients or the environment. Soiled linen must be placed in a blue linen bag and carried, 
to an approved dirty linen storage device. All linens will be cleaned by third party vendors using 
EPA approved cleaning and disinfectant products and st
andards.
 
8.
 
Patient Placement A private treatment room is required for patients to assist in 
maintaining appropriate hygiene and environmental control.

During periods of increased prevalence of respiratory infections in the community (e.g. 
Increased reporting of local hospita
lization for respiratory infections, increased school 
absenteeism) offer masks to persons upon entry into the facility or medical office and 
encourage them to maintain special separation, ideally a distance of at least six (6) feet, from 
others.
 
 
 
Worker P
rotection
 
We shall use feasible engineering controls and work practice controls to reduce employee 
exposure to infectious diseases. When those controls are not sufficient, we shall provide 
personal protective equipment. We have defined appropriate workplac
e controls for our 
various worker exposure risk classifications. Refer to Aerosol Transmissible Diseases written 
procedures.
 
 
Refer to our PPE and Respiratory Protection Programs for specific requirements where PPE 
and/or respirators are included as 
appropriate workplace controls for infectious disease 
hazards.
 
 
Workplace flexibilities and protections will be emphasized to protect workers during an 
infectious disease outbreak. Our Company will follow the recommendations of federal, state, 
and local he
alth authorities which may include, but not be limited to the following:
 

 
Have sick employees stay home
 

 
Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance 
and that employees are aware of these policies
 

 
Talk with co
mpanies that provide our business with contract or temporary employees 
about the importance of sick employees staying home and encourage them to develop non
-
punitive leave policies
 

 
Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for
 
a sick family 
member
 

 
Recognize that workers with ill family members may need to stay home to care for them
 

 
Establish policies and practices to increase the physical distance among employee and 
between employees and others if health authorities recomme
nd the use of social distancing
 
 
 

 
Implementing flexible worksites (e.g., telework)
 

 
Implementing flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts)
 

 
Increasing physical space between employees at the worksite

PROCESS & PROCEDURES
 
 
Hand Hygiene Technique
 
 
Hand hygiene may be performed with 
traditional hand washing with soap and water.
 
 

 
When washing, wet hands first with
 
water;
 

 
Then, apply an amount of product recommended by the manufacturer to hands and rub hands 
together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, covering all surfaces of the 
hands and
 
fingers;
 

 
Rinse hands with water and dry thoroughly with a disposable
 
towel;
 

 
Use towel to turn off the
 
faucet;
 

 
Avoid using hot water, because repeated exposure to hot water may increase the risk of 
dermatitis.
 
 
Hand hygiene with an alternative age
nt, such as a CDC recommended (60%
-
90%) alcohol
-
based 
hand rub (gel or foam) is acceptable. When decontaminating hands with an alcohol
-
 
based hand 
rub,
 
 

 
Apply product to palm of one hand and rub hands together, covering all surfaces of hands and 
fingers, u
ntil hands are
 
dry;
 

 
Follow the manufacturer's recommendations regarding the volume of product to
 
use;
 

 
The product may be used 8
-
10 times consecutively before traditional hand washing with soap 
and water is
 
required.
 
 
PLEASE NOTE:
 
Alcohol
-
based hand rub is not effective against spore
-
forming bacteria (i.e. 
Clostridium 
difficile, Bacillus anthraces) or most gastrointestinal viruses (i.e. Norovirus) 

 
hand hygiene 
with soap and water is 
required 
when handling specimens or caring for a
 
patient known or 
suspected to have one or more of these pathogens.
 
 

 
Hand hygiene will be performed upon entering and leaving a patient room
 
Indications for Hand Washing and Hand Antisepsis
 
A.
 
When hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with 
proteinaceous material or are visibly 
soiled with blood or other body fluids, wash hands with an antimicrobial soap and
 
water.
 
B.
 
Before eating and after using a restroom, wash hands with a non
-
antimicrobial soap and 
water or with an 
antimicrobial soap and
 
water.
 
C.
 
If hands are not visibly soiled, use an alcohol
-
based hand rub for routinely decontaminating 
hands and/or wash hands with an antimicrobial soap and water in the following clinical
 
situations:
 
1.
 
Before having direct contact with
 
patients.
 
2.
 
After contact with a patient's intact skin (e.g., when taking a pulse or blood pressure, 
and lifting a
 
patient).
 
3.
 
After contact with body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, non
-
 
intact 
skin.
 
4.
 
After contact with inanimate objects (including tre
atment room and medical 
equipment) in the immediate vicinity of the
 
patient.
 
   
 
 
 
 
PacificCollege.ed
u
 
44
 
5.
 
Before donning and after removing
 
gloves.
 
o
 
Remove gloves after caring for a patient. Do not wear the same pair of gloves for 
the care of more than one patient, and do not 
wash gloves between uses with 
different patients.
 
 
Other Aspects of Hand Hygiene
 
A.
 
Do not wear artificial fingernails, including gel overlays, extenders, or 
embellishments when having direct or indirect patient
 
contact.
 
B.
 
Keep natural nail tips less than 1/4
-
i
nch long. Keep polish in good
 
repair.
 
C.
 
Germs can live under artificial fingernails both before and after using an alcohol based hand 
sanitizer and handwashing.
 
D.
 
Avoid rings with settings and excessive
 
jewelry.
 
 
Facilities
 
Campus leadership reviews 
facilities to ensure that hand hygiene stations, including sinks, are 
appropriately and conveniently located.
 
 
Inability of Healthcare Workers to Perform Hand Hygiene
 
Hand hygiene is an essential component of a healthcare workers job responsibilities (e.g.
 
direct and 
indirect patient care providers), and the healthcare worker must be able to appropriately perform 
hand hygiene. Adequate hygiene of the hands and forearms can be impeded by prosthetic devices 
(e.g. casts and braces) that cannot be removed. Ther
efore, if a healthcare worker is required to wear 
such devices, he/she is evaluated by the Safety Officer on a case by case basis to determine if the 
healthcare worker can participate in direct patient care duties. If Safety Officer determines that the 
hea
lthcare worker cannot perform direct patient care duties, it will be the responsibility of the Safety 
Officer to decide whether or not non
-
patient care duties can be performed by the healthcare worker.
 
 
Dermatitis
 
Healthcare workers with dermatitis related
 
to hand hygiene or glove use are encouraged to report the 
problem to the Safety Officer. Follow
-
up will vary with the severity of the dermatitis. A change in the 
type of hand hygiene agent and/or gloves used by the healthcare worker or work restrictions w
ill take 
place only after the approval of Safety Officer
 
 
Lotion
 
Lotion will be supplied in the clinical settings. Lotions brought in from home are not allowed in the 
clinical settings as they may not be compatible with other hospital
-
approved hand hygiene
 
products 
and/or gloves.
 
 
 
 
Patients/Families/Visitors
 
Healthcare workers will educate patients, families and visitors on hand hygiene.

PROCESS & PROCEDURES 
-
 
Continued
 
 
Gloves
 
Gloving is 
particularly important for persons with non
-
intact skin, i.e. cuts, abrasions, skin lesions or chapped hands. Gloves 
are considered a single patient use item and should be changed in between patients.
 
Types of Gloves Available
 
The following types of 
gloves are available for use at Pacific College of Health and Science:
 
1.
 
Latex
-
free.
 
2.
 
Specialty gloves, such as the heavy
-
duty utility gloves for facilities
 
personnel.
 
 
Indication for Glove Usage
 
1.
 
Gloves (clean) are worn when a reasonable likelihood of contact
 
with blood, body substances, secretions, excretions, 
mucous membranes or 
non
-
 
intact skin is
 
anticipated.
 
2.
 
Gloves are donned immediately before starting a procedure or task and not sooner. This ensures that the gloves do 
not touch potentially contaminated 
surfaces.
 
3.
 
Gloves are required when contaminated items or surfaces are
 
handled.
 
4.
 
Gloves are removed immediately after use, before touching non
-
contaminated surfaces or other patients and hand 
hygiene is performed
 
immediately.
 
5.
 
Gloves are changed 
between
 
patients.
 
6.
 
Gloves, regardless of type, do not take the place of hand
 
hygiene.
 
7.
 
Gloves are changed if holes, cracks, or tears are
 
present.
 
8.
 
Gloves are required for specific jobs and duties and during outbreak control
 
measures.
 
9.
 
When wearing a gown, 
the cuffs of the gloves are placed over the gown
 
cuffs.
 
 
Note: 
Gloves are worn only when necessary. The use of gloves as a protective substitute for hand hygiene creates a false 
sense of security. This results in less hand hygiene and increases the 
risk of transmission of pathogens. Despite the use of 
gloves, hands can still become contaminated:
 
 
1.
 
The growth of microorganisms already present on the hands is promoted by the warm, moist environment 
created when wearing
 
gloves.
 
2.
 
Hands frequently become co
ntaminated when removing
 
gloves.
 
3.
 
Gloves may have microscopic perforations or may tear during use, allowing some penetration of
 
microorganisms.
 
 
In addition, the inappropriate and excessive use of gloves contributes to skin problems and allergies related to
 
glove use.
 
 
Proper Removal of Gloves
 
1.
 
Grasp outside of glove with opposite gloved hand; peel
 
off.
 
2.
 
Hold removed glove in gloved
 
hand.
 
3.
 
Slide fingers of ungloved hand under remaining glove at
 
wrist.
 
4.
 
Peel glove off over first
 
glove.
 
5.
 
Discard gloves in 
appropriate waste container.

GOWNS
 
1.
 
Gowns are worn when the risk of being splashed or otherwise contaminated with 
small 
amounts of infective material 
is anticipated (i.e. the splash is unlikely to penetrate through the gown) and as required.
 
 
Indication for Gown Usage
 
1.
 
Gowns and protective apparel are used if a high risk of splashing or spraying or contamination by direct contact with 
blood or body substances is
 
anticipated.
 
2.
 
All gowns are removed promptly (before leaving room or immediate work a
rea) when contaminated with blood or 
body substances and discarded in the appropriate
 
receptacles.
 
3.
 
Keep the gown off the floor, touch only the inside of the gown, and tie in back and clothing must be covered
 
completely.
 
 
Proper Removal of Gowns
 
1.
 
Unfasten
 
ti
es.
 
2.
 
Pull away from neck and shoulders, touching inside of gown only. 
(Gown front and sleeves are
 
contaminated)
.
 
3.
 
Turn gown inside
 
out.
 
4.
 
Fold or roll into a bundle and discard into appropriate
 
receptacle.
 
 
Masks /N95 or higher
-
level respirator
 
Indication for Mask Usage
 
1.
 
Masks are worn during procedures that may cause the splashing or spraying of body substances.
 
2.
 
Masks are removed and discarded immediately after each
 
use.
 
3.
 
Put on a mask before donning gloves and press the metal tab on the nose 
bridge to ensure a secure fit. Tie in such a 
way that there is no venting on the sides and chin
 
area.
 
4.
 
Surgical masks are used for Droplet Precautions and an N95 mask is used for Airborne
 
Precautions.
 
 
Proper Removal of Mask
 
1.
 
Grasp bottom ties, then top ties
 
or elastics and remove. (Front of mask/respirator is contaminated, 
DO NOT
 
TOUCH
).
 
2.
 
Discard in appropriate waste
 
receptacle.
 
 
 
Protective Eyewear
 
Protective eyewear, safety glasses and mask, a mask and face shield, or a face shield visor alone may be 
worn depending on 
the amount of protection required.
 
 
A mask and protective eyewear (e.g. glasses, goggles, or face shield) are indicated when splashing or spraying of body 
substances into the mouth, nose or eyes is possible and/or can be anticipated.
 
 
Gog
gles and/or masks with a fluid shield extension are available in all patient care areas. If prescription glasses are used as 
protective eyewear, glasses with side shields are required or cover prescription eyewear with safety goggles.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.
 
Put on 
protective eyewear after putting on mask but before donning gloves if splashing or spraying of blood or body 
substances is
 
anticipated.
 
2.
 
Reusable protective eyewear/faceshield are removed and cleaned immediately with the hospital
-

If prescription glasses are to serve as PPE, the glasses are required to have side shields.
 
4.
 
Non
-
disposable goggles and faceshields are disinfected with the EPA approved disinfectant after each use. If 
contaminated with visible body substances, the goggles or faceshields are placed in a clear, biohazard
-
labeled plastic 
bag and placed in the biohazard canister. A third
-
party hazardous waste disposable company will pick it up and 
properly transport and dis
pose of it.
 
 
Shoe Covers
 
Shoe covers should be worn if splashing or spraying of blood or body substances is anticipated.
 
 
Additional Barrier Apparel or Personal Protective Equipment
 
Appropriate barrier apparel or personal protective equipment (PPE) is 
used when indicated by the work setting (e.g. a patient 
treatment room), the procedure, (e.g. when aerosolization, spraying, or splashing of body substances are reasonably 
expected) or the patient's condition (e.g. the patient has tuberculosis).
 
 
Disposal 
of Personal Protective Equipment
 
PPE is removed upon completion of each patient contact requiring its use. It is not to be saved for reuse. Disposal is perfor
med 
in a manner that minimizes hand, skin, clothing, and environmental contact with body substance
s on PPE. Disposable PPE is 
discarded in waste receptacles lined with plastic bags; non
-
disposable linen PPE is placed in plastic fluid
-
resistant bags. Hands 
are washed before leaving the room/area where the contact occurred.

Personal Protective Equipment for Screeners
 
 
Level 1 procedure mask:
 
Use one per person per day. The mask should be on continuously throughout 
shift with removal for breaks or 
lunch. Discard level 1 procedure mask if visibly soiled, wet, or damaged 
or at the end of your shift.
 
 
Eye Protection
 
(goggles/face shield/eye shield

 
varies by site) these are reusable and should be cleaned 
with germicidal wipes in

between team member use
. Use soap and water or alcohol swab to clear any 
foggy residue left behind on eye protection after cleaning.
 
 
Non
-
sterile gloves:
 
Gloves should only be changed if contaminated or exposed to mucus membranes. 
Hand hygiene between each patient in place of gl
oves is also acceptable. Gloves and/or increased hand 
hygiene are required when taking temperature even if using a thermometer type that does not touch 
the other person (ex: infrared thermometer).
 
 
Resources to Contact
 
 
If you need help with nuanced cases 
that need leadership decisions or if you have questions/concerns 
during your screening shift, contact the Director of Clinical Services or the Campus Director using the 

 
 
Documentation
 
 
Screeners will keep a log of each scree
ning in the screening binder. If an employee or student screens 
positive for a temperature and/or one of the daily symptoms, the information will be provided to the

specific information.
 
 
Currently there is no federal OSHA ATD standard, and no other state has 
a specific standard 
covering ATDs. Pacific College of Health and Science, New York Campus has adopted the 
standards of California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 
5199
, the Aerosol Transmissible 
Diseases (ATD) Referring Employer Model standards as they apply to employers who have 
employees with occupational exposure to infectious diseases that spread by inhalable particles 
and droplets. Covered employers are required to protect their employees fro
m infection by 
establishing and implementing a set of written procedures. 
 
 
Employers must establish written programs or procedures depending on which category they 
fall into: 
 
Employers who must comply with the full standard 
 
Referring employers 
 
Laborato
ries
 
 

prepare certain written procedures but do not need to create a full ATD Exposure Control Plan. 
If you are a referring employer, then you may use this blank template

Determining if You Are a Referring Employer
 
 
You are a referring employer under 8 CCR 5199 if you meet all of the following criteria:
 
 
 
Screen persons for airborne infectious 
diseases (AirID).
 
 
Refer any person identified as a case or suspected case of AirID to another health 
care provider for treatment.
 
 
Do not intend to provide further medical services to AirID cases and suspected cases 
beyond first aid, initial treatment or sc
reening, and referral.
 
 
Do not provide transport, housing, or airborne infection isolation to anyone 
identified as an AirID case or suspected case unless the transport provided is only 
non
-
medical transport in the course of a referral.
 
 
People identified or
 
suspected as having an illness requiring droplet precautions do not need to 
be referred for treatment.

For more help on determining if you are a referring employer or a full
-
standard employer, see 


refer to that publication for more information regarding requirements of referring employers.
 
 

 
All four criteria apply to my establishment so I am a referring employer under section 5199 
and I am able to use this mod
el program to create my procedures. 
 
 
Referring employers are required to establish, implement, and maintain effective written 
procedures containing specific elements to reduce the risk of transmission of aerosol 
transmissible diseases (ATD) to employees. 
 
These written procedures must be available to 
employees at the workplace. 
 
 
The written procedures on the following pages include the following information:

Designation of the Administrator
 
 
We are required to assign an administrator who will be responsible for impl
ementing these 
procedures. This person is knowledgeable in infection control principles as they apply to our 
facility, service, and operation.
 
 
 
In our facility, the administrator of the infection control procedures for aerosol transmissible 
diseases is: 
K
ellie Knight, Director of Clinical Services/Safety Officer
 
 
When the administrator is not present at the workplace, the following person is designated to 

Malcolm Youngren Campus Director
 
 
Infection Control Procedures to C
ontrol the Risk of Transmission of 
ATDs
 
 
We conduct a risk assessment of all the job classifications at our workplace to determine which 
of our employees have occupational exposure to ATDs. We examine the job duties of all of our 
employees, being careful n
ot to forget those in administrative, maintenance, custodial, 
security, dining, transportation, and other job classifications, as applicable.
 
 
Occupational exposure is defined in 8 CCR 5199 as 
exposure from work activity or working 
conditions that is 
reasonably anticipated to create an elevated risk of contracting any disease 
caused by aerosol transmissible pathogens (ATPs) or aerosol transmissible pathogens
-
laboratory (ATPs
-

higher than what is considered ordinary for employees having direct contact with the general 
public outside of the facilities, service categories, and operations listed in subsection (a)(1) of 
this standard.
 
 

 
(check only if applicable) We are not a hea
lth care provider, so when we conduct the risk 
assessment, we consider employees to have occupational exposure if they are reasonably 
anticipated to have exposure risk higher than that of employees who work in public contact 
operations that are not covered
 
under the scope of this standard, such as retail clerks or bus 
drivers.
 
 
Our employees in the following job categories have occupational exposure to ATDs: 
 
 
 
-
 
Employees in classification A
-
 
classification A lists all jobs that have occupational exposure 
to 
blood or OPIM on a regular basis, and in which such exposures are considered normal course of 
work.
 
-
 
Employees in classification B 
-
 
classification B lists all jobs in which employees may have an 
occasional exposure to blood or other potentially infect
ious materials, and in which such 
   
 
 
 
 
10
 
exposures occur only during certain tasks or procedures that are collateral to the normal job 
duties.
 
-
 
Employees in classification C
-
 
classification C lists all jobs in which employees have very low 
risk of 
exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials, and in which such exposures 
occur only during certain tasks or procedures.

When people exhibit symptoms of an aerosol transmissible disease, they may contaminate 
surfaces with 
infectious pathogens. Therefore, surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected to 
reduce the risk of transmitting disease to employees or others. Surfaces include equipment, 
work areas, and vehicles that were used to transport people with ATD symptoms.
 
 
The following employee(s) are responsible for cleaning and disinfection:

Clinic Supervisors are responsible for for ensuring that clinical students properly clean 
and disinfect treatm
ent rooms between each patient. 
 

 
Clinic staff are responsible for cleaning commonly touched areas in the clinic. 
 

 
All employees are responsible for cleaning their workstations. 
 
 
 
 
We use the following EPA
-
registered product(s) to perform this cleaning and
 
disinfection: 
Alpha 
bac 4.5, simple green d pro plus, multipurpose disinfectant. 
 
 
We will clean and disinfect the following surfaces, equipment, and objects (include locations 
when appropriate, i.e., rooms and vehicles): 
 
 
All classrooms, tables and chai
rs, door handles, office areas, bathrooms, students lounge, 
reception areas, waiting areas, treatment rooms, library, hallways, changing rooms.
 
 
On the following schedule (
e.g., after contact with a symptomatic person, after every patient, at 
the end of ea
ch day
): 
 
 
Every morning before campus opens, during the day every 30 mins, after each class session, 
after every treatment in the clinic, at the end of every day, when closing.
 
 
Source Control Procedures
 
 
If we observe respiratory infection symptoms in a 
patient or other person who has entered our 
facility, we will utilize source control measures to minimize the risk that our employees will 
contract the illness while the suspected ATD case is in our facility. These include a combination 
of engineering cont
rols, such as placing the suspected ATD case in a separate room or area; 
procedures, such as providing and having the suspected ATD case wear a surgical mask; and 
work practice controls, such as limiting contact with the suspected ATD case.
 
 
(
Check the fol
lowing boxes, as applicable
):
 
 

 
We are a fixed

We are a correctional facility.
 
 

 
We checked one of the above boxes. Therefore, we must incorporate the recommendations

We will post a sign requesting that patients and persons accom
panying them inform the 
receptionist if they have a persistent cough.
 
 

 
We place the visual alerts at the following entrances and other locations:

classrooms, office areas, bathrooms, student lounge, faculty lounge, waiting areas, reception 
a
reas, treatment rooms
 
 

 
We will ensure that the 
(
job title[s], e.g., receptionists
) 
 
Receptionist, Clinical Services Assistant
, who may be the first employees to encounter a patient 
or other person entering the facility, are knowledgeable in observing
 
for signs and symptoms of 
ATD.
 
 

 
Provide tissues in waiting areas.
 

 
Place a waste receptacle in waiting areas.
 

 
Ensure handwashing facilities including soap and water are accessible to patients and 
visitors.
 

 
Provide alcohol
-
based hand sanitizer or other antiseptic handwash in waiting areas.
 

 
Provide individuals exhibiting ATD symptoms with a surgical mask or
 
procedure mask and 
instruct them in proper use, using the following communication methods to educate the 
individual on the importance of the control measure without making them feel stigmatized: 
 
-
 
Visual signs, Instruction Handout (see Pacific College OS
HA folder)
 
 

 
Separate symptomatic individuals from others by placing them in a separate room that:
 

 
has its own separate ventilation system.
 

 
does not have its own separate ventilation system.
 
 

 
Separate symptomatic individuals from others by distance in the same room (at least 3 to 6 
feet away from others) because our facility does not have a separate room in which to 
temporarily place the individual(s).
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
15
 

 
Advise health care staff to use drop
let precautions (i.e., wear a surgical or procedure mask) 
or airborne precautions (i.e., wear an N95 filtering facepiece respirator for which the employee 
has been medically evaluated and fit tested), as appropriate, in addition to standard 
precautions whe
n in close contact with a patient showing symptoms of a respiratory infection, 
particularly if fever is present.
 
 

 
Limit contact with symptomatic individuals.
 

 
Other 
Place symptomatic individual in isolation room before referring to appropriate 
treat
ment facility
 

 
 

 
 
We also inform patients and others who enter our facility of our source control measures using 
the following methods: 
 
-
Visual Signs
 
-
Guidelines attached to emails
 
 
We inform our employees that an individual may have an AirID using 
the following procedure 
or methods: 
Campus wide email alerts
 
 

 
If a suspected AirID
 
case refuses to or cannot comply with our source control measures, our 
employees will wear N95 respirators for which they have been medically cleared and fit tested 
when in proximity of the individual. Refer to our written Respiratory Protection Program f
or 
details.
 
 
Screening and Referral Procedures
 
 
We do not treat patients who appear to be infected with an airborne infectious disease (AirID). 
Instead, we refer them to an appropriate facility for treatment and airborne infection isolation. 
We are not req
uired to refer seasonal influenza cases to other facilities during flu season.
 
 
(Check the appropriate box)
 
 

 
We are a medical facility so our health care staff screen patients using the following 
procedures: 
 
Upon arrival patients are asked the followi
ng questions:
 
Are they exhibiting an elevated temperature of 100 degrees or more? 
 
Are they exhibiting a cough, chills or flu
-
like symptoms? 
 
 

 
We are not a medical facility so we must establish criteria and procedures for referral of 
persons to a healt
h care provider for further evaluation within timeframes described on page 
   
 
 
 
 
16
 
10. We are required to refer people who have any one of the following characteristics so we 
use this list as our criteria for referral: 
 
 
Have a cough for more than three weeks that is not explained by non
-
infectious conditions. 
 
Exhibit signs and symptoms of a flu
-
like illness during March through October (the months 
outside of the typical period for seasonal influenza), or exhibit these si
gns and symptoms 
for a period longer than two weeks at any time during the year. These signs and symptoms 
generally include combinations of the following: coughing and other respiratory symptoms, 
fever, sweating, chills, muscle aches, weakness, and malaise
.
 
State that they have a transmissible respiratory disease, excluding the common cold and 
seasonal influenza.
 
State that they have been exposed to an infectious ATD case, other than seasonal influenza.
 
 

 
To determine if people have any of the above symp
toms or characteristics, we use the 
following screening procedures from Appendix F of the Cal/OSHA ATD standard:
 
 
1.
 
For screening a coughing client with potential TB 

 
privately ask the person the following:
 
a. if he/she has had a cough for more than three weeks. 
 
b. if, in addition to cough, he/she has had one or more of the following clinical symptoms 
of TB disease:
 
Unexplained weight loss (>5 lbs).
 
Night Sweats.
 
Fever.
 
Chronic Fatigue/Malaise.
 
Coughing up b
lood.
 
 
 
A person who has had a cough for more than three weeks and who has one of the other 
symptoms in b. must be referred to a health care provider for further evaluation, unless 
that person is already under treatment. Consider referring a person 
with any of the above 
symptoms, if there is no alternative explanation.
 
 
2.
 
In addition to TB, other vaccine preventable aerosol transmissible diseases, including 

considered when
 
non
-
medical personnel screen individuals in non
-
health care facilities. The 
following is a brief list of some findings that should prompt referral to a health care provider 
for further evaluation when identified through a screening process:
 
 
 
Severe cough
ing spasms, especially if persistent; coughing fits may interfere with eating, 
drinking and breathing.
 
Fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, poor appetite followed by painful, swollen 
salivary glands, one side or both sides of face under jaw.
 
Fever, ch
ills, cough, runny nose, watery eyes associated with onset of an unexplained rash 
(diffuse rash or blister
-
type skin rash).
 
   
 
 
 
 
17
 
Fever, headache, stiff neck, possibly mental status changes.
 
 
 
3.
 
Any client who exhibits any of the above described findings and repor
ts contact with 
individuals known to have any of these transmissible illnesses in the past 2
-
4 weeks should 
be promptly evaluated by a health care provider.
 
 
4.
 
Health officials may issue alerts for community outbreaks of other diseases. They will 
provide scr
eening criteria, and people must be referred to medical providers as 
recommended by the health officer.
 
 

 
(
check if applicable
) We coordinate with local health departments, including TB control 
programs, for the success of this referral policy.
 
 

 

privacy will be maintained during screening procedures. These are our procedures for 
maintaining client privacy during screening: 
 
Initial screening questionnaire 
done at reception area to maintain patient privacy.  
 
Potentially symptomatic patients will be moved to isolation room for further questioning 
and/or referral.
 
 
We understand that the longer the symptomatic individuals are present in our facility, the 
grea
ter the risk that one of our employees will become infected. Therefore, we will ensure that 
persons exhibiting respiratory symptoms identified using the above screening procedures are 
referred and transferred to a suitable facility for isolation and treatm
ent within five hours of 
being identified as a case or suspected case, except under any of the following conditions: 
 
 
1.
 
The initial encounter with the case or suspected case occurs after 3:30 p.m. and prior to 7 
a.m., in which event we will ensure that 
transfer occurs no later than 11:00 a.m.
 
2.
 
We have contacted the local health officer, determined that there is no facility that can 
provide appropriate airborne infection isolation, and complied with all of the conditions in 
section 5199(e)(5)(B)2. (See bel
ow.)
 
3.
 
The case meets the conditions of either of the exceptions to subsection (e)(5)(B) (See 
below).
 
 
Section 5199(e)(5)(B)2. requires the following:
 
 
If we are unable to transfer the patient within 5 hours of identification, we will document each 
of the fo
llowing at the end of the 5
-
hour period and at least every 24 hours thereafter:
 
 
1.
 
We have contacted the local health officer.
 
2.
 
There is no AII room or area available within that jurisdiction.
 
3.
 
Reasonable efforts have been made to contact 
establishments outside of that 
jurisdiction, as provided in the Plan.
 
   
 
 
 
 
18
 
4.
 
All applicable measures recommended by the local health officer or the Infection 
Control physician or other licensed healthcare provider (PLHCP) have been 
implemented.
 
5.
 
All employees who 
enter the room or area housing the individual are provided with, and 
use, appropriate personal protective equipment and respiratory protection in 
accordance with subsection (g) and section 5144, Respiratory Protection of these 
orders.
 
 
The following are th
e two exceptions to the requirement for timely transfer of AirID cases or 
suspected cases:
 
 
Where the treating physician determines that transfer would be detrimental to a patient's 
condition, the patient need not be transferred. In that case, we will ensu
re that 
employees use respiratory protection, such as an N95 respirator, when entering the 
room or area housing the individual. The patient's condition will be reviewed at least 
every 24 hours to determine if transfer is safe, and the determination will be
 
recorded. 
Once transfer is determined to be safe, we will ensure that transfer will be made within 
the time period described above.
 
 

determination using the following proced
ure: 
 
This is not applicable to our facility as the patient will have to be referred to the 
appropriate healthcare facility for treatment. Pacific College is not an overnight facility. 
 
 
Where it is not feasible to provide AII rooms or areas to 
individuals suspected or confirmed 
to be infected with or carriers of novel or unknown ATPs, we will provide other effective 
control measures to reduce the risk of transmission of the ATD to employees, which will 
include the use of respiratory protection.
 
 
In the event that this exception applies, we will ensure that employees use the source 
control procedures described earlier in this document and wear N95 respirators when in 
proximity to the patient. 
 
 
In the event that no suitable facility with an airbor
ne infection isolation room (AIIR) is available 
to accommodate the patient, the administrator named in the beginning of this plan will contact 
the local health officer and other nearby medical facilities. This contact will occur at the end of 
the five (5) 
hour period following initial contact with the suspect case to see if an AIIR is 
available to accommodate transfer. If not, then the Administrator will continue to contact the 
local health officer and other medical facilities in and outside of the local he

jurisdiction every 24 hours until an AIIR becomes available for the transfer. When an AIIR 
becomes available, the Administrator will ensure that the patient is transferred to the other 
facility.

Procedures to Communicate with Our Employees, Other Employers, 
and the Local Health Officer
 
 
Good communication is a key element of an effective program to prevent the spread of aerosol 
tran
smissible disease among staff and the public. Therefore, we have developed the following 
procedures for communication among our own staff, with other employers, and with the local 
health officer regarding the diagnosed or suspected infectious disease statu
s of referred 
patients.
 
 
We communicate with our own staff regarding the suspected or confirmed infectious disease 
status of patients we refer using the following methods (
e.g., email, morning huddles, etc.): 
Staff will be notified via email. 
 
 
If the refe
rred patient is transferred among different departments or units within our facility, 

infectious disease status with each other using the following procedure (
e.g., 
coded signs, 
charts, verbal handoff
): 
The referred patient will not be transferred to other departments. 
 
 
 
If we know or should know the infectious disease status of a patient whom we refer, then it is 

uch as the facility that accepts the 
suspected AirID case for airborne infection isolation. We will also communicate the status to 
any employer who transports the patient from our facility to the next in their vehicle. If there is 

uch as law enforcement, from whom we received the suspected 
AirID case, we will also communicate this status with them so that they may offer necessary 
medical intervention to their exposed employees.
 
 
When providing information to the facility to which th
e patient was transferred, we will also 
obtain information from them in order to inform our own employees who may have been 
exposed to the referred person so that we may offer them appropriate medical services.
 
 
The person responsible for communicating thi
s information to the other employers is: 
The 
administrator at the time of the incident, primarily Safety Officer/Director of Clinical Services 
 
 
This is our procedure for notifying downstream employers and gathering information from 
them: 
Upon calling tran
sport via downstream employers, the Administrator will verbally 
communicate the infectious disease status of the referred patient.  Additionally, we will inform 
the transport driver of the infectious disease status of the patient prior to acceptance into t
he 
vehicle. 
 
 
This is our procedure for notifying upstream employers: 
Upon calling any upstream employers, 
we will verbally communicate the infectious disease status of the referred patient so that they 
can offer medical intervention to their 
exposed employees.
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
24
 
This is our procedure for communicating infectious disease status of our patient with the local 
health officer: 
The Administrator will contact the NYC Health Department using the PAL 
(Provider Access Line) to report the status of the infected patient. The phone call will be 

fold
er. 
 
 
Procedures to Reduce Risk of AirID Transmission in the Interim
 
 
During the period that the person requiring referral is in our facility or in contact with our 
employees, we take measures to reduce the risk of AirID transmission to our employees. This
 
includes constant observation of standard precautions as well as other protective measures, 
including the use of respiratory protection.
 
 
In addition to the previously described source control procedures, we also take the following 
measures.
 
 
We place the
 
person requiring referral in this separate room or area (or airborne infection 
isolation room if available) while they await transfer to another facility for airborne infection 
isolation: 
 
 
Room 1 on 19 and Room 2 in the clinic.
 
 
If feasible, this room mu
st be equipped with a separate ventilation or filtration system. (
Check 
one of the following boxes
):
 

 
This room or area is equipped with a separate ventilation system.
 

 
This room or area is equipped with its own filtration system.
 
 
If the person requ
iring referral does not comply with our established source control measures, 
our employees will wear NIOSH
-
certified (
type of respiratory protection, e.g., N95 filtering 
facepiece
) 
KN95 mask 
when entering that room or area.
 
 
Before our employees wear 
respirators, we will provide them a medical evaluation to 
determine if they are medically fit to wear a respirator. We will also provide fit tests for them to 
determine which brand/model/size respirator offers the required level of protection to each 
indiv
idual employee. We will also implement our written Respiratory Protection Program.
 
 
For Law Enforcement or Corrections Employers Only:
 
 
(
Check one of the following boxes
):
 
 

 
 

 
 

  
 
   
 
 
 
 
25
 

 
 
 
System of Medical Services
 
 
We provide medical services to our employees with occupational exposure to aerosol 
transmissible disease. 
These medical services, including vaccinations, tests, examinations, 
evaluations, determinations, procedures, and medical management and follow
-
up, wi
ll be
 
 
1.
 
Performed by or under the supervision of a physician or other licensed healthcare provider 
(PLHCP).
 
2.
 
Provided according to applicable public health guidelines.
 
3.
 
Provided in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of employees and patients, such as 
l
eaving the name of the source individual off of test results and other information regarding 
exposure incidents and TB conversions.
 
 
Vaccinations
 
 
Vaccination is a safe, effective, and reliable method of controlling the spread of infectious 
diseases that have a vaccine. Vaccination not only prevents vaccinated people from becoming 
infected, but it also helps to prevent transmission of illness to the unvaccinated because there 
are fewer susceptible people to spread the disease. We make vaccina
tions available to our 
employees at no cost during their work hours and encourage employees to receive them.
 
 
For employers who employ health care workers
 
 

 
We employ health care workers and are required to offer all vaccinations for aerosol 
transmissib
le diseases that are recommended by the California Department of Public Health 
(CDPH) to our susceptible health care workers. These vaccinations are listed in the table below. 
We make them available to employees after they receive training and within 10 wo
rking days of 
initial assignment unless one of the following conditions exists: 
 
 
1.
 
The employee has previously received the recommended vaccination(s) and is not due to 
receive another vaccination dose.
 
2.
 
A PLHCP has determined that the employee is immune in 
accordance with applicable public 
health guidelines.
 
3.
 
The vaccine(s) is contraindicated for medical reasons.
 
 
We send our health care worker employees to the following medical facility to receive the 
vaccinations: 
Weill Cornell 

 
New York Presbyterian Hospital or Fort Greene Health Center
 
 
These will be provided at the doses and by the schedules recommended by the
 
CDPH as stated 
in the following table.
 
   
 
 
 
 
26
 
 
Vaccine
 
Schedule
 
Influenza
 
One dose 
annually
 
Measles 
 
Two doses
 
Mumps 
 
Two doses
 
Rubella

Tetanus, 
Diphtheria, and 
Acellular Pertussis 
(Tdap) 
 
One dose, 
booster as 
recommended
 
Varicella
-
zoster 
(VZV)
 
Two doses
 
 
 
We will make additional vaccine doses available to employees within 120 days of the issuance 
of any new applicable public health guidelines recommending the additional dose.
 
 
We do not require our employees to 
participate in a prescreening serology program prior to 
receiving a vaccine, unless applicable public health guidelines recommend the prescreening 
prior to administration of the vaccine.
 
 
We train our employees about the vaccines we offer, including the ef
ficacy, safety, method of 
administration, the benefits of being vaccinated, and that they are offered free of charge. We 
strongly encourage our employees to receive the vaccinations, but employees have the option 
to decline to receive any of them. If an em
ployee declines a vaccination, we have them sign the 
appropriate declination form, which will be kept in their employee file.
 
 
If an employee declines any of the vaccinations listed in the box above, we will have them sign 
the following declination for eac
h declined vaccination:
 
 
Vaccination Declination Statement
 
 
I understand that due to my occupational exposure to aerosol transmissible diseases, I may be 
at risk of acquiring infection with
 
(name of disease or pathogen)
. I have been given the 
opportunity to be vaccinated against this disease or pathogen at no charge to me. However, I 
decline this vaccination at this time. I understand that by declining this vaccine, I continue to be 
at risk of acquiring 
(name of disease)
, a serious disease. If in the future I continue to have

es a vaccination but at a later date, while still covered under the 
standard, decides to accept the vaccination, we will make the vaccine available within 10 
working days of receiving a written request from the employee.
 
 
For 
all
 
referring employers
 
 
We pr
ovide the seasonal influenza vaccination to all our employees during the period 
designated by the CDC (flu season), which generally begins in October and lasts through April.
 
 
We send our employees to 
Weill Cornell
-
NYP Hospital or CityMD
 
to receive the sea
sonal 
influenza vaccine.
 
 
 
We train our employees about the influenza vaccine, including the efficacy, safety, method of 
administration, the benefits of being vaccinated, and that it is offered free of charge. We 
strongly encourage our employees to receive
 
the vaccination, but employees have the option 
to decline to receive it. If an employee declines the seasonal influenza vaccination, we will have 
the employee sign the following declination, which will be kept in their employee file. This will 
be done eac
h flu season.
 
 
Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Declination Statement
 
 
I understand that due to my occupational exposure to aerosol transmissible diseases, I may be 
at risk of acquiring seasonal influenza. I have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated 
against this infection at no charge to me. However, I decline this vac
cination at this time. I 
understand that by declining this vaccine, I continue to be at increased risk of acquiring 
influenza. If, during the season for which the CDC recommends administration of the influenza 
vaccine, I continue to have occupational expos
ure to aerosol transmissible diseases and want to 
be vaccinated, I can receive the vaccination at no charge to me. 
 
 
(
End of declination statement
.)
 
 
If the employee later decides to accept the vaccination and it is still the period when the 
vaccine is 
available, then we will provide it to the employee within 10 days of receiving a 
written request from the employee.
 
 
If a vaccine is not available due to shortages or other reasons, we will document our efforts to 
obtain the vaccine in a timely manner and 
inform the employees of the status of vaccine 
availability, including a timeframe of when the vaccine is likely to become available. When this 
   
 
 
 
 
28
 
occurs, this is our procedure for communicating vaccine availability to our employees: 
The 
Administrator will sen
d an email to employees to communicate availability and locations. 
 
 
This is our procedure for documenting the unavailability of the influenza vaccine or other 
applicable recommended vaccine: 
Administrator will document the unavailability of influenza 
and 
other recommended vaccines. The documentation will be filed in the Pacific College OSHA 
folder.
 
 
Latent TB Infection Screening
 
 
A latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a condition when the individual infected with the 
M. 
tuberculosis
 
bacteria does not ex
hibit symptoms and cannot spread the infection to others. 
However, approximately 5 to 10% of these people will develop active, potentially contagious TB 
disease if untreated. LTBI screening helps to ensure that employees are provided with 
appropriate treat
ment for new TB infections and that previously unidentified occupational 
exposures are identified so that we may correct any deficiencies in our infection control 
procedures.
 
 
We offer latent TB infection screening (skin test, blood test, or screening ques
tionnaire) 
annually to all employees who we determined to have reasonably foreseeable occupational 
exposures to ATD. We include employees if their occupational exposure risk is greater than that 
of employees in public contact operations that are not includ
ed within the scope of the ATD 
standard, such as bus drivers and retail clerks.
 
 
If applicable public health guidelines or the local health officer recommends more frequent 
testing, then we will comply with the recommendation.
 
 
We send our employees to the
 
following facility for the LTBI screening: 
Washington Heights 
Chest Center
 
 
Employees with a baseline positive TB test will receive an annual symptom screening 
questionnaire. If questionnaire results indicate further testing is needed, then we offer that 
employee a follow
-
up screening (PPD, blood test, or chest x
-
ray), using the following 
procedures: 
Employee will be sent to New York Presbyterian Hospital. If employee is uninsured, 
they will be sent to the Washington Heights Chest Center. 
 
 
If employees ex
perience a TB conversion (i.e., previous LTBI screening was negative, but now it 
is positive), we will refer them to the following PLHCP knowledgeable about TB for evaluation: 
The employee will be sent to New York Presbyterian Hospital. 
 
 
In the event of a
 
TB conversion, we will also do the following:
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
29
 
1.
 
Provide the PLHCP with a copy of this standard and the employee's TB test records. If we 
have determined the source of the infection, we will also provide any available diagnostic 
test results 
including drug susceptibility patterns relating to the source patient.
 
2.
 
We will request that the PLHCP, with the employee's consent, perform any necessary 
diagnostic tests and inform the employee about appropriate treatment options.
 
3.
 
We will request that the
 
PLHCP determine if the employee is a TB case or suspected case 
and do all of the following if the employee is a case or suspected case:
 
a. Inform the employee and the local health officer in accordance with Title 17.
 
b. Consult with the local health 
officer and inform us of any infection control 
recommendations related to the employee's activity in the workplace.
 
c. Make a recommendation to us regarding precautionary removal due to suspect active 
disease, in accordance with subsection (h)(8), and prov
ide us with a written opinion in 
accordance with subsection (h)(9).
 
 
The person responsible for ensuring that the above TB screening procedures are implemented 
is: 
The Safety Officer/ Director of Clinical Services
 
 
When an employee experiences a TB convers
ion, the person who will receive the 
recommendations from the PLHCP on infection control and precautionary removal is: 
Safety 
Officer/Director of Clinical Services
 
This person will then communicate the recommendations to 
the following managers or staff mem
bers, if applicable: 
Human Resources and Campus 
Director.
 
 
In the event of a TB conversion, we will also record the case on the OSHA Form 300 Log of 
Work
-



investigate the circumstances of the conversion and correct any deficiencies in the procedures, 
engineering controls, or PPE that were involved. 
 
 
List the job titles and roles 
of staff involved in investigating the circumstances of the conversion 
and correcting deficiencies (
e.g., Administrator, infection preventionist, employee health 
coordinator, safety manager
): 
The Director of Clinical Services along with Campus Director wil
l 
conduct the investigation. 
 
 
We will also document the investigation using the following procedure: 
Record the incident on 
the Pacific College Incident Report form and OSHA 300 form log.
 
 
If we subsequently find that the TB infection is not work
-
related,
 
then we may remove the 
entry from the OSHA Form 300 Log.
 
 
Exposure Incidents
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
30
 
In the event of an exposure incident, it is critical to inform exposed employees quickly and 
provide medical services in a timely manner to minimize the severity of illness and limit the 
spread of infection. 
 
 
An exposure incident is an event where all 
of the following have occurred:
 
 
1.
 
An employee has been exposed to an individual who is a case or suspected case of a 
reportable ATD, or to a work area or equipment that is reasonably expected to contain an 
aerosol transmissible pathogen associated with a re
portable ATD.
 
2.
 
The exposure occurred without the benefit of applicable exposure controls required by the 

 
3.
 
It reasonably appears from the circumstances of the exposure that transmissi
on of disease 
is sufficiently likely to require medical evaluation.
 
 
A reportable ATD (RATD) is an aerosol transmissible disease that a health care provider is 
required to report to the local health officer, in accordance with Title 17 CCR, Division 1, 
Cha
pter 4.
 
 
 
In the context of this regulation, a health care provider is a physician and surgeon, a 
veterinarian, a podiatrist, a nurse practitioner, a physician assistant, a registered nurse, a nurse 
midwife, a school nurse, an infection control practitione
r, a medical examiner, a coroner, or a 
dentist.
 
 

 
 

 
We are a health care provider. Therefore, when we determine that a person is an RATD case 
or suspected case, we will report the case to the local health officer, in accordance with title 17, 
observi
ng the different time deadlines for different diseases.
 
 
Name/job title of person(s) responsible for reporting RATD cases and suspected cases to 
local health officer: 
 
Kellie Knight, Director of Clinical Services 
 
 
Contact information for the local health 
officer: 
NYC Health Department PAL

To see the current list of RATDs and the timeframes and methods in which they must be 
reported, we will refer to the California Department of Public Health, 
Division of Communicable 
Disease Control

. 
 
 
Regardless of whether we are require
d to report the case to the local health officer, we are 
required to determine, to the extent that the information is available in our records, whether 
any employees of other employers may have had contact with or been exposed to the case or 
suspected case
. If so, we will notify the other employer(s) within a reasonable timeframe but no 
later than 72 hours after either the report is made to the local health officer or we became 
aware of the exposure incident. This allows the other employer(s) time to conduc
t their own 
analysis to determine which of their employees had significant exposure and to provide their 
employee(s) with effective medical intervention to prevent disease or mitigate the disease 
course.
 
 

had contact with the case or suspected case while working within our facility or operations: 
The 
Administrator will communicate to the other employees who may have had
 
contact with the 
suspected case while working within our facility via email within 24 hours of becoming aware of 
the exposure incident .
 
 
Our procedures to notify other employers whose employees may have had significant exposure 
are as follows: 
The Administrator will communicate to the other employer of employees who 
may have had contact with the suspected case while working in our facility via email 
notification within 72hours of awareness of the exposure incident. 
 
 
We are also required to noti
fy our own employees who had significant exposure to the ATD 
case or suspected case. First, we will conduct an analysis of the exposure scenario to determine 
which of our employees had significant exposure. As required, we will complete this analysis 
withi
n a timeframe reasonable for the specific disease, but no later than 72 hours after either 
our report to the local health officer or our receipt of notification from another facility or local 
health officer of the exposure.
 
 
We will document the analysis, 
recording the names and any other employee identifier used at 
the workplace of persons who were included in the analysis. We will also document the name 
of the person who made the determination and the identity of any PLHCP or local health officer 
consulte
d in making the determination.
 
 
The person(s) responsible for conducting and documenting this analysis is 
the Campus Director 
and Director of Clinical Services 
 
 
Our procedures for conducting this analysis are as follows (e.g., manager reviews patient char
t 
to see which employees had contact with the ATD case or suspected case; manager interviews 
employees): 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
32
 
 
-
Managerial review of the chart to see which employees and students had       contact with ATD 
case.
 
-
 
Review clinic schedule to identify who was pr
esent during the ATD incident
 
-
 
Manager interviews affected employees and students 
 
 
If the analysis determines that either of the following conditions exist for an employee, then 
that employee does not require post
-
exposure follow
-
up and we will document 
the basis for 
the determination:
 
1.
 
The employee did not have significant exposure.
 
2.
 
Physician or other licensed health care provider (PLHCP) determined that the employee is 
immune to the infection.
 
 
We will make the exposure analysis available to the local he
alth officer upon request.
 
 
Upon determining which of our employees had significant exposure, we will notify them of the 
date, time, and nature of their exposure within a timeframe reasonable for the specific disease 
but no later than 96 hours of becoming 
aware of the potential exposure.
 
 
Our procedures to notify our employees who had significant exposure are as follows: 
The 
Campus Director will notify employees with significant exposure via verbal and/or email 
communication.
 
 
As soon as feasible, we will p
rovide all our employees who had a significant exposure a post
-
exposure medical evaluation by a PLHCP knowledgeable about the specific disease. The medical 
evaluation will include appropriate vaccination, prophylaxis, and treatment. For 
M. tuberculosis
 
(th
e group of different bacterial species that cause tuberculosis) and for other pathogens where 
recommended by applicable public health guidelines, this will also include testing of the isolate 
from the source individual or material for drug susceptibility, 
unless the PLHCP determines that 
it is not feasible.
 
 

 
We will send our employees to the following facility or provider for post
-
exposure medical 
evaluation: 
Weill Cornell 
-
 
New York Presbyterian Hospital 
 
 

 
We are a healthcare provider, so we will notify employees that they have the right to decline 
to receive the medical evaluation from us, and we will ensure that the employee receives post
-
exposure evaluation and follow
-
up from an outside PLHCP.
 
 
Director 
of Clinical Services 
will provide the following information to the PLHCP who conducts 
the post
-
exposure medical evaluation and follow
-
up:
 
 
1.
 

 
2.
 
The circumstances under which
 
the exposure incident occurred.
 
   
 
 
 
 
33
 
3.
 
Any available diagnostic test results, including drug susceptibility pattern or other 
information relating to the source of exposure that could assist in the medical management 
of the employee.
 
4.
 
All of our medical records fo
r the employee that are relevant to the management of the 
employee, including tuberculin skin test results and other relevant tests for ATP infections, 
vaccination status, and determinations of immunity.
 
5.
 
A copy of 8 CCR 
5199
 
and applicable public health guidelines.
 
 
We will request from the evaluating PLHCP an opinion on whether precautionary removal from 

the 
disease agent and what type of alternative work assignment may be provided. We will 
request that any recommendation for precautionary removal be made immediately by phone 
or fax and also in writing.
 
 
 
The person responsible for requesting the written opini
on is: 
Director of Clinical Services
 
 

working days of completion of all required medical evaluations.
 
 
We will provide the copy to the employee using the following proc
edure: 
A copy of the PLHCP 
will be provided to the employee via email.
 
 
If the PLHCP or local health officer recommends precautionary removal, we will maintain the 

e is 

former job status as if they had not been removed or otherwise medically limited.
 
 
For TB conversions and all RATD and ATP
-
L exposure incidents, the written o
pinion will consist 
of only the following information:
 
 
1.
 
The employee's TB test status or applicable RATD test status for the exposure of concern.
 
2.
 
The employee's infectivity status.
 
3.
 
A statement that the employee has been informed of the results of the 
medical evaluation 
and has been offered any applicable vaccinations, prophylaxis, or treatment.
 
4.
 
A statement that the employee has been told about any medical conditions resulting from 
exposure to TB, other RATD, or ATP

19,prepar_covid19.pdf,"        WYORK TEOF ORTUNITY. ANDREW M. CUOMO Governor Department of Health HOWARD A. ZUCKER, M.D., J.D. Commissioner SALLY DRESLIN, M.S., R.N. Executive Deputy Commissioner To: CEOs, Government Liaisons, and Medical Directors Re: Preparedness for Coronavirus (COVID
-19) Date: March 5, 2020 
Please share this information with all staff as appropriate. 
As you are most likely aware, in late 2019, a new Coronavirus was identified as the cause of an outbreak of 
acute respiratory illness (COVID
-19) in Wuhan, China. Since then, an increasing number 
of COVID
-19 cases 
have been reported in other countries, including the United States, and now New York. The purpose of this 
guidance is to instruct the Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans to develop and institute strategies for COVID
-19 preparedness that ensures timely member access to all relevant information and needed health care 
services. 
This guidance is effective immediately and shall remain in effect for the remainder of the disaster emergency 
declared by Executive Order No. 202, or until the issuance of subsequent guidance by the NYSDOH prior to the 
expirati
on of such state disaster emergency declaration. 
Additional guidance to MMC plans will be forthcoming as testing capabilities are expanded and other information 
becomes available. An emergency declaration may require changes to this guidance. At this time, the MMC 
plan™s COVID
-19 preparedness strategy should include, at a minimum, the following components: 
1) Emergency preparedness plan 
 MMC plans should review and update their internal emergency preparedness plan 
as needed to ensure 
infrastructure stability and business continuity so that care is delivered to members in the event of the 
further spread of COVID
-19 in New York. 
2) Prompt access to all needed services 
 The COVID
-19 oral/nasal swab test is currently only performed and funded through public health 
laboratories, including the CDC and Wadsworth Laboratories. As approval is granted for additional 
laboratories, the test will likely become billable to, and payable by, health plans. 
 MMC plans must ensure prompt member access to all services relevant to COVID
-19 care, including 
outpatient services, telehealth services, inpatient services, emergency services, screening and 
diagnostic tests, medications, treatments, and emergency transportation services. 
 Such procedure includes evaluation and removal of preauthorization requirements that may delay 
access to medically necessary treatment for COVID
-19. MMC plans should be prepared to expedite 
utilization review and appeal processes for services related to COVI
D-
19 when medically appropriate. 
3) Proper member guidance and education 
 MMC plans must implement processes to provide information and resources to members on how to 
protect themselves and minimize transmission of the virus and assist members with understanding how 
and when to access services for COVID
-19 care. Available resource links are below in #6. 
4) Proper provider guidance and education 
 MMC plans must implement processes to promptly answer all provider questions and concerns about the 
relev
ant covered services and ensure that providers deliver all necessary care to members.

       5) Prompt access to appropriately trained providers 
 MMC plans must ensure their provider networks are adequate and appropriately trained in the COVID
-19 care and are ready to handle a potential increase in the need  for health care services in the event of a 
rise in COVID
-19 cases. If 
an MMC plan lacks a provider network with sufficient providers with the 
appropriate experience to meet the health care needs of members affected by COVID
-19, the MMC plan 
must provide access to out
-of-network providers to meet the needs of its COVID
-19 affected membe
rs. 
 Provider guidance is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019

20,Press Release Response to Covid-19_Oklahoma .pdf,"      You are subscribed to Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Commission. This 
information has recently been updated, and is now available.
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   3/18/2020
   Oklahoma State Agencies Respond to Covid
-19 Exposure 
   March 18, 2020, 
Oklahoma City 
- Workers™ Compensation Commission 
Œ The Oklahoma Workers™ Compensation Commission (WCC) and Court of Existing Claims (CEC) 
closed their hearing rooms and all administrative offices, initially for two days, March 16 and 17, 
and have now exten
ded closure for the entire week of March 16. Further, both the Commission 
and the Court have stricken all scheduled hearing dockets for the week of 
March 16 through 20 in 
19.-response to a potential exposure in their facilities to COVID
   ﬁOur first 
priority is the health and safety of our employees and the public we serve. We have taken 
this action out of an abundance of caution, and in order to give the subject matter experts the time 
to study our situation and give us measured, rational, fact
-based
 advice.ﬂ said Commissioner Mark 
Liotta, Chairman of the WCC.
   Timeline of Decision Making
    On Saturday, the WCC was made aware of a possible Exposure to COVID
-19 in the Oklahoma 
City Offices and immediately contacted the State Health Department and The 
Governor™s Office for 
Direction. The WCC notified employees of a possible exposure that afternoon and advised 
employees to take precautions and await further instructions until the individual™s test results were 
communicated.
 Once the WCC received notifica
tion late Sunday that the individual tested positive for COVID
-19, 
Commissioner Liotta immediately informed the Executive Branch and contacted the Oklahoma 
County Health Department for their latest advice and guidance.
   The WCC and CEC closed their agenci
es in OKC and Tulsa for two days to provide authorities 
time to consider and then evaluate the best next steps. An Alert was sent out to the Public and 
Employees with notification of the closure.
 Since this decision was made, the evaluation has been comple
ted, and the office will remain 
closed the rest of the week. The WCC also cancelled all docketed cases for the week of March 16 
to greatly minimize the traffic in both buildings and limit potential exposure. Continuing operations 
will be re
-evaluated and n
ew information will be provided no later than 
.22Sunday, March 
   ﬁAs facts were identified and confirmed, we focused on getting the information to the appropriate 
authorities and to our employees. We don™t take this action lightly, and we know it will ha
ve an 
impact on the lives of injured workers and their cases. However, our immediate concern is to limit 
any exposure and reduce the possible spread of infection where we can.ﬂ said Liotta.
   Process Going Forward
   The Chairman has authorized the administ
rative law judges of the WCC to continue processing 
certain aspects of cases remotely, when possible. Once reopened, the WCC will utilize 
telecommuting for a small number of employees who logistically can work remotely. The WCC is 
coordinating with officia
ls at the State Office of Management Enterprises (OMES) to ensure the 
Denver Davison Building is appropriately cleaned and safe for employees and the public.
  Other 
tenants in the building, including the Real Estate Commission and the Court of Civil Appeal
s, have 
been notified regarding the situation and the WCC™s decisions.
    ﬁFrom the time we first heard of the exposure, through confirmation of test results, and initiating 
action, staff members made themselves available all weekend, and were responsive an
d calm as 
we responded to this situation. Coincidentally, just last Thursday, we heard a planned briefing from 
our Medical Director, Dr. Jay Cannon, and I met with our leadership Thursday and Friday to 
develop our plan of action if faced with this situatio
n. We just didn™t expect it to happen the very 
next day.ﬂ said Liotta.
   The WCC is a quasi
-judicial administrative and regulatory agency in the executive branch which 
exercises the State™s judicial authority to adjudicate workers™ 
compensation cases. Its three 
commissioners currently employ forty
-three staff members, including six administrative law judges 
(ALJ). Case dockets are randomly assigned to the ALJs in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.
    The CEC is the judicial branch agency, whic
h by statute is entrusted to hear older workers™ 
compensation cases, and currently employs eight employees under Court Administrator Dustin 
Davison.

 Section 1: 
COVID
-9 Vaccination 
Preparedness Planning
 Instructions:
  A. Describe 
you
r early 
COVID
-19 vaccination program planning activities
, includ
ing
 lessons learned 
and improvements made 
from 
the 2009 
H1N1 
vaccination 
campaign
, seasonal influenza 
campaigns,
 and other 
responses
 to identify gaps in preparedness
.  The Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) began initial planning 
discussions
 on August 25, 2020
 with an internal team representing
 the
 immunization
 division
, emergency response and state partner 
leadership
. A weekly 
meeting schedule was set to k
eep everyone informed of Operation Warp Speed 
(OWS) guidance
. Meeting cadence increased as the playbook and 
other 
detailed guidance became 
available
; eventually, a 
twice
-weekly
 schedule was established 
while 
workgroups 
connect
ed daily 
updat
ing
 plan details and program 
management
 functions.
 The 
Immunization 
Service
 has lead the 
technical components and provider enrollment process, while other divisions 
with
in OSDH 
us
e 
their 
advanced stakeholder relationships an
d logistical 
skills
 to advance the plan
. The Oklahoma National Guard 
and specialists from other state agencies 
add their leadership expertise 
to the entire pandemic response 
including vaccine planning
. This broad leadership representation will be key as we
 ope
rationaliz
e the plan.
 The planning team is comprised of several OSDH divisions, including local health department leadership 
with community level H1N1 experience
. Both rural and urban health departments are represented
. Beyond OSDH, other core planning
 team members represent the follow sectors: Governor™s Office
 and 
Cabinet
, Oklahoma National Guard, Office of Emergency Management, Indian Health Service, Chickasaw 
Nation, 
Oklahoma Hospital Association, Oklahoma and Tulsa City
-County Health Departments, 
and other 
state agencies.
 A list of statewide vaccine planning stakeholder entities is provided in the appendix
.  Each planning member has access to the After Action Report from the H1N1 pandemic response
. Those 
who experienced or have knowledge of the 200
9 operations are vocal and have key roles in 2020 COVID
-19 Vaccine Plan 
development
. Important
 lessons learned from H1N1 incl
ude the following:
 A) 
Vaccine allotment and distribution to 
tribes
 missed the mark
 in 2009.  
There are 38 federally 
recognized trib
es 
and no reservations in 
Oklahoma
.  Tribal operations and 
tribal 
healthcare are 
critical 
to all 
sectors in Oklahoma, especially Public Health.  
Therefore, t
he OSDH tribal liaison, 
IHS
 leadership and other tribal leaders are at the table 
as we make decisio
ns for all Oklahomans.
 Additionally, plan drafts will be shared with the 
OSDH Tribal Advisory Board, Southern Plains Tribal 
Advisory Board, Oklahoma City Area 
IHS
 and tribal leaders to
 gain input and feedback throughout 
the planning and implementation proc
ess
; B) 
In the initial weeks of the H1N1 vaccine push, 
very limited portions
 arrived in 
Oklahoma and
 cam
e directly to OSDH for dissemination.  During the early days of Phase I, low vaccine supply
 in 
expected; therefore, the planning team is 
using past experience to 
develop 
messaging that will 
help explain
 the 
rationale
 behind 
difficult decisions 
concerning first 
priority
 populations to receive 
the vaccine
; and
    OSDH

 This COVID Vaccine Plan document should be considered a fluid, flexible, working draft and not a final product. Much remains 
unknown about 
the COVID vaccine. This working draft utilizes multiple planning assumptions, hypothetical scenarios, and preliminary
 information. As additional 
guidance and information becomes available, the plan will change. 
 C) The public did not 
consistently return for the second dose of H1N1 vaccine as ex
pected 
complicating efficient inventory management systems. Therefore, saving vaccine for the second 
dose of COVID
-19 is not recommended.
 This is reinforced by the reality that 
ultra
-cold
 chain 
storage and handling of some of the COVID
-19 vaccine presents 
many challenges to storing 
vaccine for a prolonged period of time.  
Resupply and ordering 
of COVID
-19 vaccine
 will be 
complex and
 must 
be 
monitored 
continuously
 to ensure 
appropriate 
tracking and 
admini
stration
 of 
second doses.
 Influenza vaccine 
campaigns
 and preparedness activities
 over the past fifteen years in Oklahoma
 communities
 have included mass immunization clinics
 and other medical counter measures exercises
.  While the COVID
-19 vaccine will 
initially
 be in short supply and 
logistically challengin
g, if mass vaccination 
is indic
ated, throughputs and capabilities are known and practiced throughout Oklahoma 
Point of 
Distribution 
(POD
) locations
.  Example, on September 25, 2020, a small local county health department
 was able to vaccinate 270 people pe
r hour in a scaled down POD (two lanes, six stations, and 10 
vaccinators).  
The swab testing PODs for this current pandemic response offers additional insight into 
location capacity and 
manpower considerations.  
Limitations for COVID
-19 vaccine cl
inics
 wil
l include 
ultra
-cold
 chain monitoring/capabilities
 and paperless technology/connectivity for patient information 
and vaccine tracking.
 B. Include 
the number/dates of and qualitative 
information on planned workshops or tabletop, 
functional, or full
-scale 
exercises
 that will be held prior to COVID
-19 vaccine availability. Explain 
how continuous quality improvement occur
s/will occur
 during the exercises a
nd implementation 
of the COVID
-19 Vaccination Program
. During the planning phase, continual review
s of th
e COVID
-19 vaccine plan
s, the 
process and
 the
 projected operational needs 
take place twice 
weekly
 through in person meetings, shared document sites 
and virtual
 interactions
. A schedule of facilitated workshop
 discussions
 with 
chief stakeholders was 
establi
shed to familiarize local county health departments, tribes, hospitals, providers, federally qualified 

health centers and long term care facilities with 
plan considerations and components.  Each workshop 
allowed the stakeholder
s to view current planning 
considerations 
and offer input/concerns/ideas 
which 
offers a profound effect on overall success of this vaccination program
™s ability
 to reach critical 
populations
, ultimately maximizing impact. 
CDC trainings and meetings information was also shared 
so 
participants could
 attend sessions based on their availability and interest.  
 A workshop exercise was conducted on October 8, 2020 
with the following objectives: 
to 
ensure state and 
agency leadership are familiar with 
operational assumptions and potential
 controversial
 decisions they 
will face,
 to identify
 critical areas where 
risk communication and messaging 
is of crucial importance to 
success or failure of this plan, and to indicate where gaps 
exist
 in the plan.

guidance and information becomes available, the plan will change. 
 Outcomes of the workshop included:
  Emphasis 
was giving to 
LTCF staff being our 
first 
focus 
for priority populations
.  It was understood
 vaccine for this population would come from the state allocation.
  Some discussion 
occurred 
about
 fluidity of priority groups in reference to elimination of waste, uptake rates of vaccine 
among this population
, and final vaccine 
types, logistical considerations, and 
indications
.  Communication messages 
regarding 
vaccine safety trials and 
the meaning of
 Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) will be produced 
to 
initiate a public awareness campaign. 
Once the plan is 
submitted
, the
 Joint Information Center (JIC) 
will begin disseminating and educating the public 
about the COVID
-19 Vaccine Progra
m and to begin pr
eparing targeted messages for unique 
circumstances.
  A survey of s
pecific priority groups and
 the broader state was discussed to assess attitudes relating 
to 
the COVID
-19 Vaccine 
and 
to gain 
Intel
 on develop
ment
 and 
deliver
y of
 messages 
to encourage 
vaccina
tion.  Example: Tulsa conducted 
similar 
research
 and found respondents trust their private 
doctors more than public health
; and sent a survey to Tulsa health care coalition partners to gauge 
their interest in taking the vaccine upon its availability
.  Before November,
 a communications tabletop 
workshop exercise 
will occur.  All public health 
communications staff and contractors will be present
 and other public information specialists from 
stakeholders will be invited.  The purpose of the exercise will b
e to key in on JIC roles and responsibilities, 
critical message development and 
consumer considerations.
 Section 2: COVID
-19 Organizational Structure and Partner 
Involvement
 Instructions: 
 A. Describe your organizational structure.
 In Oklahoma, the Commission
er of Health reports directly to the Governor
 and his cabinet secretary. The 
Commissioner
 is the leader of a 
centralized
 public health agency
 which covers 75 of the 77 counties in 
Oklahoma
.  The Commissioner is responsible for ensuring Oklahoma has a plan 
for
 receiving
 and 
administering 
COVID
-19 vaccine
 in 
collaboration
 with tribal partners, independent/urban public health 
departments, f
ederal entities and private providers across the state.  
 While the OSDH Immunization Division will be vital to th
is vaccine effort, it was recognized early that a 
larger operations committee will be needed to manage the complex functions necessary 
for successful 
storage, 
monitoring
, tracking and administration of COVID
-19 vaccine.  
The following functional areas 
were
 identified and leaders were assigned responsibility for the actives under each area:
 1. Population ID, Count and Tracking
 Œ identifying the various populations into which Oklahomans 
will be segmented for vaccination purposes, maintaining a count of persons i
n each population, 
and tracking vaccination
-related information for each population.

 Over 
388,000 
Oklahomans receive medical care from Indian Health Service facilities 
through federal 
healthcare facilities and/
or 
through
 independent tribal nation health systems
. This planning team 
recognizes
 the need for 
complete interconnectedness between state and tribal public health systems
. As 
core members of the Oklahoma C
OVID
-19 Vaccine Planning Committee, RADM Travis Watts, Area Director 
for the Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service, and Dr. Daniel
 Molina, Chief of Research and Public 
Health 
for the Chickasaw Nation Department of Health, 
have an active role and provide suggestions for 
the entire plan, not just the parts pertaining to tribal considerations.
 American Indian citizens account for approx
imately 10% of the population in Oklahoma and are served by 
a robust and expansive health system including federal (I
HS), urban and tribally run clinics and hospitals. 
This planning team recognizes the need for coordination and synergy between state and 
tribal public 
health systems. As core members of the Oklahoma COVID
-19 Vaccine Planning Committee, RADM Travis 
Watts, Area Director for the Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service, and Dr. Daniel Molina, Chief of 
Research and Public Health for the Chickas
aw Nation Department of Health, have an active role and 
provide suggestions for the entire plan, not just the parts pertaining to tribal considerations.

 In addition to tribal and IHS representation on the Vaccine Planning Committee, the Oklahoma State 
Depa
rtment of Health (OSDH) implemented and formalized a 'rapid consultation' and feedback process 
for all Oklahoma tribal and tribal serving stakeholders. Bi
-weekly ""all tribes"" virtual meetings were held 
to provide updates on the state planning process, seek
 feedback and guidance from tribal health experts 
and align state planning efforts with tribal and IHS entities. Initial outreach was made to tribal and IHS 

facilities with in
-patient capacity for COVID
-19 treatment to seek workforce data to assure tribal 
facilities were considered and included for this priority population.
  As the plan developed, the planning team presented assumptions and components to statewide tribal 
advisory groups and leaders of larger tribal systems
. Questions, feedback and internal 
operational 
planning for specific tribes was considered a
nd incorporated into the overall Oklahoma plan
. For example, 
the Chickasaw Nation has established a mass testing/mass vaccination operation at four of their clinic 
locations in south central Oklahoma
 that has the capacity for 1,200 vaccinations per day
. They 
will soon 
have a facility ready to expand this capacity to approximately 4,500 vaccinations per day
. They have 
graciously offered these facilities for the entire p
opulation
. This is just one examp
le of how partnerships 
will be incorporated into this plan.

 The OSDH has focused on underserved and diverse communities by partnering with specific organizations 
and associations. Through these partnerships, the agency has developed tailored messaging and reached 
out to targeted 
audience
s. The Office of Minority Health and Health Equity and other diverse OSDH staff 
have contributed time and effort by translating materials and providing interviews on multiple TV and 
radio stations statewide. These interviews have helped with common s
ense guideline outreach and 
opened lines of communication amongst various multi
-cultural communities.
 The first strategy to advance health equity is to ensure that non
-English speaking clients receive equitable 
services. This program will utilize the Natio
nal Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate 
Services (CLAS) in Health and Health Care as a framework to ﬁprovide effective, equitable, understand, 
and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health belie
fs and practices, 
preferred language, health literacy and other communication needsﬂ. 
 OMHHE will continue to work with agency leadership to implement policy and practices that promote 
professional development and increase the capacity of the public health
 workforce for those employees 
providing language assistance. Strategies include continuing education and proficiency testing. The OSDH 
will develop and provide training for agency interpreters across the state. 
 In addition to reducing language barriers a
cross public health systems, the OMHHE provides staff support 

to increase health equity and cultural competency throughout the public health system. The OMHHE staff 
supports capacity building and stakeholder engagement for state and local health improvemen
t efforts. 
The staff collaborates and consults with program staff and community engagement teams to identify data 
driven strategies to improve health. An additional emphasis will be placed on disparate populations with 
the greatest need. Capacity building 
efforts include but are not limited to identifying and convening 
stakeholders, developing communication strategies, identifying community resources and assessing 
needs and researching evidence
-based strategies.
 Faith
-based communities:
 Oklahoma has its own
 unique combination of faith
-based organizations (FBO) that has evolved as a result 
of history, geography, cultural diversity, median age, and migration patterns, etc.  The FBOs are born of a 

history of providing services and support. They provide access t
o their communities and are vital to the 
entry of outsiders to the many cultures that make up our state 
Œ because they are trusted.  The OMHHE 
currently works in collaboration with the Community & Faith Engagement arm of the Infant Mortality 
Alliance (IMA)
. This collaboration meets quarterly and focuses on enhancing family and community 
systems that can have broad impacts on minority families and communities. 
 The OMHHE will continue to leverage collaboration and build relationships with faith
-based organiz
ations, 
leaders and congregants. Identifying those faith
-based organizations with a capacity and desire to partner 
involves inquiry and discover.  Experience has shown that many things are possible when systems partners

 1) 
 Save lives and maximize benefits of vaccine to overall pandemic response mitigation.
 2) 
 Treat all people with equal regard and mitigate health

regarding 
all aspects of the program including 
vaccine allocations and supply deployment
. Each phase of 
the operation will require specific messaging and communication to the public and to vaccine

dical professionals
 representing the following sectors: 
 infectious disease, biomedical research 
specific to immunology, tribal health systems, dentistry, 
family practice, and internal medicine

 The 
Oklahoma 
COVID Vaccine 
team 
acknowledges there are many unknowns regarding COVID vaccine
 including but not limited to the
 type, 
amount, 
indication, and logisti
cal considerations
 of the vaccine
. As 
such, the plan is being built on hypothetical scenarios and planning assumptions, based on information 
and guidance that is known today. 
This plan is intended to be flexible and fluid and allows for future 
changes a
s more 
information
 becomes known
 to 
the state.
 The state anticipates 
the possibility for 
significant revisions to the plan upon receiving confirmed
, finalized
 information regarding 
the initial 
federal 
vaccine 
distribution to 
Oklahoma. 
 For example, ultra
-cold 
(-80C) 
vaccine may be the first 
available from manufacturers and may be shipped 
in 1000 dose lots. 
Current CDC guidance indicates large, 
closed
-pod, 
mass
-vaccination sites with ultra
-cold 
storage capabilities may be necessary as vacci
ne 
storage containers
 may only be opened twice daily, 
requiring very large volumes of doses to be administered in a very short period of time (e.g. less than 6 
hours), and prohibiting the ability for vaccine to be transported to multiple sites
. The prepositioning of 
stock would likely be necessary at central 
locations across the state that have adequate ultra
-cold storage 
capacity and 
physical space and staff to accommodate 
mass
-vaccination throughput. 
In this example, the 
appropriate 
initial 
distribution channel may be large, metropolitan health systems
 curre
ntly serving COVID 
patients
 where 
it is possible for 1000 doses to be administered to the phase 1 priority groups within a 6 
hour period. Such a distribution channel would likely require planning for 
communication to the phase 1 
priority groups indicating 
the scheduling system for their receipt of vaccine, priority group 
individuals
 arriving at
 the 
mass vaccination site, 
and 
development of throughput and post
-vaccine monitoring 
processes.
 As additional ultra
-cold vaccine become available, other large health systems may be utilized 
as 
closed
-pod, 
mass
-vaccination sites. 
 In contrast, another example could assume the initial availability of cold (
-20C) vaccine
 available from 
manufacturers and
 shipped in 20 dose lots. Such cold vaccine could be maintained in commercial 
refrigeration
 units
, which are 
more 
widely ava
ilable
 than ultra
-cold units
. Smaller vaccine storage 
containers with 20 dose increments, coupled with the ability for health care f
acilities to utilize available 
freezer space, could allow for vaccine transportation, storage and adm
inistration at facilities who 
serve/staff phase 1 priority populations in smaller volumes. In this example, 
the appropriate initial 

distribution channel co
uld include a wide variety of health system
 facilit
ies (e.g. long term, nursing, 
assisted living facilities, etc) who serve/staff phase 
1 priority groups. V
accination could occur among
 groups of 20 individuals (per the vaccine storage container capacity) a
nd operate in a closed
-pod
 setting. 
Like the example above, planning for communication to and scheduling of the phase 1 priority groups 

would need to occur, however more flexible, smaller scale vaccination events would be feasible given the 
different logis
tical consid
erations of the cold (
-20C) vaccine type.
 Healthcare staff working in Long Term Care 
and Assisted Living 
Facilities will be the first priority.  Vaccine 
supply for 
these staff will be initially provided by the state allocation, especially durin
g instances of very 
limited supply. Later in Phase I and subject to implementation of federal Pharmacy Partners Plan

LHD
 personnel have long standing relationships with
 the hospitals in their areas
 and 
will be able to

  During phase 1, Oklahoma will p
rovide COVID
-19 vaccination services in closed point

-dispensing (POD) 
setting that allows for maximum number of people t
o be vaccinated while maintaining social distancing 
and other infection control procedures
. Closed PODs will conducted by private and public providers during 
this phase
. This is to ensure vaccine remaining after patients in the intended POD are vaccinated 
is 
transferred to another location or to another critical population identified in phase 1 to eliminate the 
chance for waste of the vaccine
.  While vaccine is limited, t
he Immunization 
Service
 will ensure all pandemic vaccine providers enrolled in 
the prog
ram are educated and trained on vaccine handling, storage and administration
. Additional 
attention will be given to pandemic providers serving Phase I critical populations to ensure not onl
y their 
enrollment, but understanding and capacity to manage the ne
w COVID vaccine as it is initially made 
available
. The Immunization 
Service
 will be responsible for ensuring all providers understand the reporting 
requirements and how to record, track and report patient information into 
OSIIS or 
VAMS
. A GIS map has 
been 
developed to recognize the geograph
ic representation across the state in order to identify areas 
underrepresented by enrolled vaccine providers
. This map includes overlays of 
socioeconomic data, 
transportation and language barriers 
and provider details.
 As vaccine supplies increase, the Immunization 
Service
 will increase the number of orders to be filled by 
hospitals across the state in order to reach 
healthcare workers.  
As phase
 1 develops and more priority 
groups are included in the allocation, 
Federal
ly Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and tribal health systems 
will be key to 
the distribution plan.  
Long term care staff
 and residents
 will be a focus due to their risk of 
transmitting infection to others in a 
residential facility 
serving
 our most fragile 
population.  
The LHDs will 
begin hosting vaccine cli
nics for populations 
age 65 and above 
at risk of severe morbidity and mortalit
y.
 During phase 1, Oklahoma will identify gaps in 
the
 plan and logistics.  
Continuous
 improvements and steps 
toward efficiency
 will be taken as we learn more about cold chain requirements, vaccine inventory 
tracking and patient record reporting.

 As 
vaccine supplies grow
 the 
population

phase 2 
priority 
groups
 will increase as well.  Mass 
immunization clinics will be utilized by 
the 
LHD and 
some tribes to enable quick administration and

mass immunization is instituted.  
Private providers 
may be used as

across
 Oklahoma. 
 For fifteen years, Oklahoma has 
practiced mass vaccination plans 
across the state.  Currently, each of the 

11 districts (including Tulsa and Oklahoma City) have locations 
and
 operational plans 
to vaccinate people 
quickly.  COVID
-19 vaccine will be different in some ways (
e.g. 
suggested wait time after vaccination to 
ass
es any reactions) and the same in many others
. COVID
-19 Vaccine will require attention to crowd 
grouping and sa
nitation of vaccine area to control fur
ther spread of the disease. 
 Curbside and drive in
 vaccine clinics will likely be used by providers to all
ow for quick vaccination and 
control of spread.

Suff
icient
 Supply
, Slowing Demand
 In phase 3, vaccine supplies s
hould be sufficient and priority
 populations from phases 1 and 2
 should
 have 
had the opportunity to receive the vaccine. More will be known about the vaccine effectivene
ss and 
potential side effects
. Vaccine will be available across the entire state during this phase
. The Vaccination 
Program Team 
will monitor vaccine uptake a
nd second dose coverage across all populations
. Further 
expansion of priority populations will happen.
 The state acknowledges that while critical population 
groups have been identified across all three phases of COVID
-19 vaccine availability, uptake will b
e 
dependent upon pers
onal choice 
of individuals and their employers. As time passes, phases are 
experienced, and data are collected, more will become known regarding the 
rate of uptake among the 
population
.  Vaccine storage concerns could be a concern duri
ng this phase.  If OWS logistics go as planned, the state 
should 
only 
receive
 vaccine as they need it, but 
surpluses of vaccine will likely happen in some areas due 
to slowing demand for the vaccine
. The Vaccination Program Team will ensure 
proper sto
rage 
and 
monitoring.  Vaccine will be transferred to other locations where uptake may be better.  
The JIC will 

continue 
to focus messaging toward vaccine safety and importance.

 Upon release of the CDC playbook in September, the OSDH assessed existing data sources for each of the 
critical populations identified. Both state and national datasets 
were 
sought. State level data sources were 
assessed for th
e granularity possible (e.g. county or zip code level data). At minimum, county level data 
were identified for all critical population groups. 
The approach used by the state to identify appropriate 
data included use of established, dependable, long

 of information.

 As the 
OSDH seeks and utilizes existing state and national data sources
 to quantify 
the total potential 
universe of 
critical populations 
offe

at a county and statewide level
, the results of the initial 
draft information gathering were shared among core and 
large working groups
. These statewide and 
county level estimates were used by the groups to develop an initial draft of 
the 
potential critical 
population priorities among the phases. As described above, the vaccine advisory committee was utilized 

as the group to
 make final recommendations to the Commissioner of Health regarding final
 population
 priority levels. The vaccine advi
sory committee utilized the same initial statewide and county level 
estimates used to quantify 
the total potential universe of 
critical
 populations
 offered vaccine
 to help 
inform their 
recommendation development. 
 The rate of uptake of vaccine was and is b
eing explored. 
Initial ad hoc s
urveys were conducted among 
public health 
staff, 
some hospitals, and a few 
long
-term
 care facilities
 resulting in take up rate ranges of 
approximately up to 40%. At the vaccine planning tabletop exercise
 conducted the first w
eek of October, 
a stakeholder shared that a recent, independent ad hoc survey indicated overall take up rates between 

30-50% had been estimated for the state™s population. The stakeholder group had discussion at the 
tabletop that
 anecdotal expressions of
 local, regional, and individual opinions on vaccine use 
among 
healthcare workers 
varied greatly
 with examples ranging from 0% take up to 
20% take up expressed by 
staff
 who acknowledged that many unknowns about the vaccine appeared to cause uncertainty. 
The 
need 
for a statewide survey across all critical population sectors was discussed, the timing of which should 

coincide 
closely with the vaccine availability so as to gauge most accurate opinions on uptake
 based on 
vaccine information known at that time
. Pla
ns are being discussed among the 
core

 group to 
develop such a s

 how your jurisdiction will 
determine 
additional
 subset groups of critical population
s if there is
 insufficient vaccine supply
. Urban vs rural, monitoring percentage of populations for 
race/ethnicity groups, uptake estimates and actuals for each 
critical population, 
etc.
  Initially, the availability of a vaccine will be limited due to manuf
acturing 
and logistical (e.g. ultra
-cold 
storage, packing container size (1000 doses), inability to break apart containers, limited 
vaccine viability 
timeframe after thaw/reconstitution, etc.) 
constraints. 
The distribution of vaccine 
will follow the critic
al 
population priority set forth by the advisory committee recommendations and approval by the 
Commissioner
. Additional subset groups of critical populations may be developed based upon 
comorbidities, age, e
xposure level and access to PPE. Additional 
modifications to the distribution plan
 and 
among priority populations
 may be made pursuant to logistical considerations and the changing rate of 
COVID

 The
 OSDH 
Commissioner
 of Health will receive 
recommendations from the co
re planning group and, if needed, the vaccine advisory committee to review 
and approve the subset groups of critical populations
 and associated
 allocation strategy and prioritization. 
The strategy will be influenced by CDC guidelines, disease burden, and v
accine 
type and 
supply.
 The phased
 approach for vaccine distribution 
among critical priority populations
 will be utilized. The 
methodology for the allocation of the vaccine will build upon guidance developed as part of 
COVID

 Instructions: 
Oklahoma™s allocation, ordering, distribution and inventory management will vary 
considerably based upon the project phase for vaccine administration:
 Phase 
1 will begin as tightly controlled by OSDH in order to validate this plan and ensure operational 
readiness of the stakeholders.  As the vaccinated percentage of critical population
s increases and 
operational competency is established, OSDH will relax some controls and decentralize some 
administration.
 Phase 
2 will see more and more decentralization with OSDH moving from active control to monitoring 
and approving provider actions.  
 By Phase 
3 OSDH™s role will primarily be monitoring, supervision and quality assurance.

  Letters are relative priorities within a single priority number, used to show how vaccine allotments 
received will be allo
cated to multiple populations.  Three populations assigned 2A, 2B and 2C all 
have priority two, which means they would not receive any allocation until after all priority 1 
populations are complete 
(having been offered vaccine) 
and they would all be comple
te 
(having 
been offered vaccine) 
before any priority 3 populations receive any vaccine.  Associated with each 

letter would also be a percentage, with A being the highest and B being equal to or less than A, 
and the total of all letters being 100%.  If 2A w
as 40%, 2B 40% and 2C 20%, then once all priority 
1 vaccines were distributed, the next receipts would be allocated 40%/40%/20% respectively to 
priorities 2A, 2B and 2C until they were 100% complete.  Once all A vaccines are complete for a 
particular prior
ity, additional vaccine receipts would be allocated to each letter™s prorate share of 
the remaining total.  
 The VDP 
takes the county
-level information in th
is plan and adds estimated uptake information by facility 
to estimate how each vaccine lot received
 will be 
consumed
 by various populations
.  It 
uses the PDC to 
assign each 
facility to an expected ﬁdose lot,ﬂ which is the sequentially numbered vaccine lot received 

from 
CDC. 
 This detailed plan allows OSDH Logistics 
to

 exactly where each do
se goes before it is

 OSDH will 
supplement the VDP with a 
Dose Administration Plan (DAP) 
that lists the physical administration

 for each dose lot.  
Initially in Phase 1, 
OSDH plans to administer each dose lot in a single

, the 
facility personnel who will be immunized and a back
up facility in case 
uptake is less than 
estimated from the scheduled facility population. 
A sample

.  OSDH will use the
 VDP
 and DAP to allocate and distribute vaccine 
until supply is sufficient to

 also be used, if necessary, to create 
transfer 
shipments or store Recovered Vaccines until they can be 
dist
ributed.  
 Additional partner facilities are being actively identified by the COVID planning core group team, and 
assessments of their ultra
-cold storage capacity and availability are being amassed.
 OSDH will incorporate provider storage capacity into the 
DAP described above
 (for Phases 1 and 2) 
and 
will ensure that, once direct shipments begin
 in Phase 2
, approved orders are only going to providers with 
the appropriate storage capacity.  
 Cold chain
 storage 
capacity 
will be shown on the Dashboard
/GIS map
.   OSDH assumes all federal shipments will include continuous temperature tracking devices (TTDs) for the 
original shipping container.  OSDH will purchase and use TTDs for Transfer Shipments.  
 As vaccine administration progresses into Phase II, OSDH will ensure that orders being shipped directly to 
providers do not exceed the provider™s cold storage capability or that a plan is in place for using the backup 
storage necessary to allow the provide
r to consume the entire order in an appropriate timeframe.  
 C.
 Describe your jurisdiction™s procedures for ordering COVID
-19 vaccine, including 
entering/updating provider information in VTrckS and any other jurisdictional systems (e.g., IIS) 
used for provide
r ordering. Describe how you will incorporate the allocation process described in 
step A in provider order approval.
 Early in Phase 
1, OSDH will be the only entity placing orders for vaccine, will receive all vaccines from 
federal sources and will 
administ
er vaccines 
through county health departments 
according to the 
prioritization and methods described above.  
 As OSDH control is relaxed and individual providers begin placing orders, OSDH will review and approve 
those based upon the
 VDP and DAP
.  Once gene
ral distribution begins, OSDH will monitor provider 
information in OSIIS daily and contact providers to resolve discrepancies or issues.  OSDH will also 
reconcile the information exchange between OSIIS and VTrckS daily.  
 D.
 Describe how your jurisdiction wil
l coordinate any unplanned repositioning (i.e., transfer) of 
vaccine.
 The strategy for Recovered Vaccines is described in Section 7.A above.  
 OSDH will also establish a QC hotline for providers to broadcast an alert that they have vaccines that need 
to be recovered.  OSDH™s QC group will ensure the vaccine doses are retrieved and redistributed.  This 

process is described in more detail in Sectio
n 8.  
 E. Describe jurisdictional plans for monitoring COVID
-19 vaccine wastage and inventory levels.
 OSDH will use the QC group to perform this monitoring as an extension to the hotline and Recovered 
Vaccine processes described above and in Section 8.  QC st
aff will monitor inventory levels and usage in 
VTrckS daily and, should a provider mark any vaccine as wasted or unusable, will consult with the provider 
to determine cause and any mitigation required for the future.

 Section 8: COVID
-19 Vaccine Storage and
 Handling
 Instructions: 
 A. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to ensure adherence to COVID
-19 vaccine storage and 
handling requirements, including cold and ultra
-cold chain requirements, at all levels: 
 1. Individual provider locations
 2. Satellite, temporary, o
r off
-site settings
 3. Planned redistribution from depots to individual locations and from larger to smaller 
locations
 4. Unplanned repositioning among provider locations
 OSDH assumes all vaccines received from governmental or private sources will arrive:
  In 
packaging that will maintain the appropriate cold or ultra
-cold temperature for some minimal 
number of days after OSDH™s receipt, and
  With a temperature monitoring device (TMD) that continually tracks the temperature and 
whether a temperature excursion has
 occurred in the past, and
  With an intact cold chain according to the TMD.  
 Since all Phase I shipments will be received by OSDH, its responsibilities in that phase consist primarily of:  
 Establishing an appropriate central location to temporarily store 
vaccines awaiting distribution to their 
final facility.
  OSDH will create a primary receiving facility (PRF) in Oklahoma City at a warehouse with 
the necessary cold and/or ultra
-cold storage to receive up to 100,000 vaccine doses at one time.  
OSDH is in t
he process of contracting for such a warehouse, and expects it to be in place by Oct. 21, 
2020.

container with dry ice
.  OSDH 
will centrally receive all v
accines and will transport them to the 
appropriate 
administration site
s listed in the DAP
.  Once administration is complete, OSDH 
will return 
the shipping container as instructed by CDC. 
 OSDH intends to contract for
 dry ice
 with multiple 
suppliers 
by 
Oct.
 21, 2020.  
 Establishing a quality control (QC) monitoring process to verify adherence to cold
-chain requirements.  
See detailed discussion in 8.B below.  
 Collecting, storing and redistributing vaccine doses from providers who are unable to deplete their
 supply within the projected temperature window.
  OSDH assumes that, despite detailed planning, 
there will be 
sites
 who are unable to deplete their allotted vaccine for a variety of reasons.  Providers 
will report their oversupply using the hotline (see de
scription below) and QC will coordinate with the 
Logistics team to have the vaccine retrieved and either stored or redistributed to another provider.  
 As vaccine supply grows and Oklahoma moves into Phase II, OSDH intends to allow direct vaccine 
deliverie
s to providers from federal sources

 By Phase III, OSDH™s focus will primarily be QC to ensure cold chain integrity, with a minor amount of 
effort involved in the other areas listed above.  
 B. Describe how your jurisdiction will assess provider/redistribution depot COVID
-19 vaccine storage 
and temperature monitoring capabilities.
 OSDH believes that a formal QC process is the best method for ensuring appropriate storage and cold 
chain control.  OSDH will create a QC group responsible for executing this process, with responsibilities 
for (1) sampl
ing and inspecting enrolled provider cold storage ; (2) reviewing transfer documentation for 
each change of vaccine possession; (3) providing a multi
-pronged communications hotline (telephone, 
website, text) where providers can report unused vaccine that n

 Section 9: COVID
-19 Vaccine Administration Documentation and 
Reporting
 Instructions: 
 A. Describe
 the system your jurisdiction will use to collect COVID
-19 vaccine doses administered data 
from providers.
  COVID
-19 vaccine administrations will be collected through a combination of Oklahoma State 
Immunization Information System (OSIIS), and the Vaccine Administration Management System (VAMS). 
Providers will be able to enter COVID vaccine administrations manua
lly (through web interface) or through 

HL7 messaging in OSIIS. Providers who do not have an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and do not currently 
enter vaccine data into OSIIS will be able to use VAMS to document COVID administrations and the data 
shared bac
k to the OSIIS system through the IZ Gateway.  
  B. Describe how your jurisdiction will submit COVID
-19 vaccine administration data via the 
Immunization (IZ) Gateway.
  The current plan is to pull COVID administrations from OSIIS and VAMS and then send through
 the IZ 
Gateway to the CDC using HL7 messaging. Envision (OSIIS software vendor) is currently working with 

Oklahoma Immunization Staff to determine the best way to submit the data through the IZ Gateway. 
  
A graphic depicting the state and federal vaccine information systems and their interoperability is 
provided in the appendix. 
  C. Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure each COVID
-19 vaccination provider is ready and able 
(e.g., staff is trained, interne
t connection and equipment are adequate) to report the required 
COVID
-19 vaccine administration data elements to the IIS or other external system every 24 hours.

  Data quality for COVID administrations will be monitored on a weekly basis through the various data 
quality reports available in Enhanced OSIIS to assess completeness, timeliness, and accuracy of the data. 

Deduplication will occur o
n a daily basis to ensure unique records. Reports will be performed in 
SAS/Enhanced OSIIS looking at provider submission numbers. Results of the above reports will then be 

relayed back to providers in order to improve data quality and ensure data submissio

 5. Concern surrounding the groups that will receive the vaccine as a priority 
-- i.e. ﬁwhy are only 
these folks receiv
ing the vaccine and why is it not available to others who are at risk?ﬂ 
 6. Misalignment on timeline per CDC and vaccine providers/developers versus what the President is 
saying publicly
 7. Confusion about vaccine process, especially between different brands of 
vaccines 
-- two doses 
needed and why it™s important to get both doses vs. others that may only require one dose 
 8. General skepticism about the need or effectiveness of vaccines
 Risk/Crisis/ Emergency Communication
 Crisis and emergency risk communication (CERC) is the application of evidence
-based principles to 
effectively communicate during emergencies. These principles are used by the 
JIC
 to provide information 
that helps people, stakeholders, and entire communitie
s make the best possible decisions for themselves 
and their loved ones. CERC recognizes that during emergencies, we work under impossible time 
constraints and must accept the imperfect nature of our choices. CERC principles include: 
  Be First 
  Be Right 
  Be
 Credible 
  Express Empathy 
  Show Respect 
 The JIC 
will disseminate messaging before, during, and after COVID
-19 vaccine is available to help 
communities understand the importance of vaccination as well as the benefits and risks. Communicating 
what is curre
ntly known, regularly updating this information, and continuing dialogue with media and 
other partners throughout the vaccine distribution and administration process is essential to establish 

and maintain trust and credibility.
  OSDH
 partners with key stak
eholders who will offer additional support and resources 
to 
the COVID
-19 
vaccine program
. During Phase 1, it will be critical for all stakeholders to be informed of the situation as it 
evolves to improve preparedness and coordination. Depending on urgency 
and subject, communication 

with stakeholders may be done over the phone, email or through 
routine or ad hoc r
eports. 
 Section 13: Regulatory Considerations for COVID

(NCVIA 42 
U.S.C. § 300aa
-26) 
to give the appro
priate VIS to the patient (or parent or legal representative) prior to 
every dose of specific vaccines.  We will reinforce the need to share the EUA and VISs (as applicable) and 
the ways to share the VIS as below:  
  Paper copies of the VIS can be printed a
nd given to patients prior to vaccination.
  Permanent, laminated office copies may be given to patients to read prior to vaccination.
  Patients may view VISs on a computer monitor or other video display.
  Patients may read the VIS on their phone or other digi
tal device by downloading the pdf 

file from CDC™s website.
  Patients may be given a copy of a VIS during a prior visit, or told how to access it through 

the internet, so they can read it in advance. These patients must still be offered a copy to 

read during
 the immunization visit, as a reminder.
  Patients must still be offered a copy of the VIS to take away following the vaccination
. The patient may 

decline.
  Section 14: COVID
-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring
 Instructions: 
 A. Describe how your jurisdiction will en
sure enrolled COVID
-19 vaccination providers understand 
the 
requirement and process for
 report
ing
 adverse events
 following vaccination
 to the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
  During Phase 1 of COVID
-19 vaccine distribution, information on the importance of the Vaccine Safety 
Assessment for Essential Workers (V
-SAFE) as a tool for ongoing safety surveillance will be shared with 
providers as a part of initial trainings.  These tr
ainings may be conducted in
-person, or virtually, and will 
also cover storage and handling information, the Vaccine Information Statement, and the vaccine 
manufacturer™s package insert.  
V-SAFE, will provide enhanced safety monitoring for COVID
-19 vaccine 
for 
essential workers in early phase vaccination.  
 During all phases of COVID
-19 vaccine distribution, providers will be advised to report to VAERS any 
adverse event that occurs after the administration of the vaccine.  Information on VAERS will be shared
 during the training with the vaccine providers.  They will receive VAERS brochures, in both English and 
Spanish, to distribute to those patients who receive COVID
-19 vaccine in an effort to promote self
-reporting of adverse events.

 Oklahoma State Depa
rtment of Health will  continue 
with the 
211 COVID
-19 response Hotline, which was 
created 
on March
 6, 2020
.  It has continued to be utilized by the public for general COVID
-19 questions, 
as well as testing availability. The 2

available 
in English and Spanish with the main 
menu instructing callers to ﬁPress 8ﬂ for COVID
-19. The COVID
-19 Hotline will 
be updated to 
prompt 
specifically to monitor and respond to questions from those who receive COVID
-19 vaccine. The Hotline 
is staff
ed by registered nurses, and both hours of operation and staffing may be adjusted to meet the 
demands of the public.  
 Immunization Service will create a COVID
-19 vaccine ﬁlanding pageﬂ on its website to provide vaccine 
safety information, including VAERS,
 as well as other resources such as Frequently Asked Questions, and 
links to additional educational materials.  It will also include the GIS/ARC map, which will direct the public 
to providers with COVID
-19 vaccine once the vaccine becomes more widely avail
able.  This will be a 
primary point of communication sharing related to COVID
-19 vaccine with the public, and this website will 
be included on COVID

ollout. 
The organization of the department ensures staffing roles and 
responsibilities
 are clear 
and designated to have knowledgeable people working in each area. The director of the Immunization 
Service has relationships with the CDC project liaison for o
ngoing, routine
 progress reports and technical 
assistance. Likewise, the director consults regularly and frequently with the Deputy Commissioner on 
programmatic and operational aspec
ts of the program™s rollout and monitoring. The Deputy 
Commissioner in tur

 C. Describe your jurisdiction™s methods and procedures for monitoring 
communication
, including:
   Message delivery 
  Reception 
of communication messages and materials among target audiences throughout 
jurisdiction
  The OSDH, through use of the state email system, utilizes confirmation of successful message delivery 
through a variety of ways. The first, a 
recipient™s
 reply to a message indicates success. The second, a read
-receipt
 can be requested from the 
recipient
. Third, the state email system generates a ﬁmessage 
unsuccessful
ﬂ alert when an inactive or incorrect email address is an intended recipient. In this instance, 
the sender checks the email address and verifies/corrects 
- or performs a warm reach out via phon
e call 
to secure the proper contact information. Distribution lists are maintained for all target audiences, and as 
updates/corrections are received, the master lists are updated. 
  D. Describe your jurisdiction™s methods and procedures for monitoring l
ocal
-level 
situational 
awareness (i.e., strategies, activities,
 progress
, etc.)
. The County Health Departments associated with OSDH have been providing situational awareness 
reporting for all COVID
-19 response efforts
 through Teams Channels and spreadsheets
.  Th
is includes
 daily 
testing numbers, school case monitoring, long term care testing project and Department of Corrections 
outbreaks
 and much more
. The requirements concerning vaccine tracking, 
White House 
recommendations, 
reporting and recall of patients 
will allow for
 easier
 quantit
ative
 oversi
ght
, but to 
capture daily happenings rela
ted to vaccine, a spreadsheet tracking mechanism will be used.  Tulsa and 
Oklahoma City health 
departments
 will be given access to those spreadsheets.
 Two days per week, the 
regional administrative directors from all nine OSDH health districts gather on a 
morning briefing call at 0730 to receive briefings from the state, to provi
de local
-level situational 
awareness on 
all things COVID and to organize response activities across
 the state.  
 Local health departments, including OCCHD and THD, have a number of modalities for use in urgent and 
emergency situations when communication is critical. Communication platforms may include but not 
limited to phones, office and mobile (to inc
lude SMS), 800 MHz radios, email, Situation Reports, web 
conferencing, call downs, and WebEOC.  Any and al
l modes of communication can be used to gain real 
time updates and situational awareness from the field.

-19preparednessandresponseplan
   Employees are encouraged to maintain 
the recommended 
physical distance 
of six feet from other 
individuals at work, on b
reak
s, and while moving from place to place during work hours,
 as well 
as before and after working hours
;   Employees are required to maint
ain physical distance when reporting to work, clocking in, 
leaving work, and clocking out
;  Employees™ 
workstations

space between parties; and 
  Non
-essential
 travel is postponed or cancelled.
   WSU 
provides employees with, at a minimum, non
-medical
-grade face coverings. 
 Employees™ ﬁworker exposureﬂ is classified as 
medium
 risk by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration™s guidance because they 
frequently and/or closely interact with the general public.  WSU 
may thus also install physical ba
rriers where feasible, limiting exposure of
 and
 to the general public, and 
minimizing face
-to-face contact.    
 In addition, 
WSU 
is instituting the following cleanliness measures: 
  Where possible, i
ncreas
ing
 ventilation rates and 
air 
circula
tion throughout
 work sites;
  Separation of work spaces as necessary;
  Performing 
routine environmental cleaning and disinfec
tion, especially of common areas
 and 
bathrooms
; and 
  Where available, providing 
hand sanitizer in high
-traffic areas. 
 Employees are expected to minimize COVID
-19 exposure by: 
  Cleaning 
workstations
 at the beginning and end of each shift; 
  Avoiding, when possible, the use of other employees™ phones, desks, offices, or other work tools 
and equipment; 
  Wearing face covering 
or face mask

  b. Supplemental Measures Upon Notification of 
Employee™s 
COVID
-19 Diagnosis 
and/or Symptoms 
 An employee with a COVID
-19 diagnosis or who displays 
symptoms consistent with COVID
-19 must 
be immediately 
removed from the worksite.
   In response to a confirmed diagnosis
 or display of COVID
-19 symptoms
, the WSU Campus Health 
Center:
  Conducts systematic 
investigation and 
contact tracing and i
nform
s all employees with and near 
whom the diagnosed
/symptomatic
 employee worked 
of a potential exposure
;  Keeps confidential the 
identity 
of the diagnosed
/symptomatic
 employee; 
  Follows the curren
t CDC guidelines for mitigation and quarantine based on the specific incident 
and contact tracing
; and
   Report
s the need for 
deep cleaning of the diagnosed
/symptomatic
 employee™s workstation
, as 
well as those common areas potentially infected by the employ
ee. All employees who worked in sustained
, close proximity
 to the diagnosed
/symptomatic
 employee
, as 
identified by contact tracing
, are also removed from the worksite
 for at least 14 days; however, should 
these exposed employees later develop COVID
-19 symptoms and/or receive a confirmed diagnosis, they 
may not report on
-site until all re
turn
-to-work requirements are met, 
defined below. 
   WSU 
completes an OSHA Form 300
, as well as a Form 30
1 in accordance with OSHA guidelines 
for 
determining whether the precipitating e
vent or exposure occurred in the work environment or e
lsewhere
. If an employee infects a coworker, the coworker has suffered a work
-related illness if one
 of the 
recording criteria (e.g., medical treatment o
r days away from work) is met. 
 2. Identification and Isolation of Sick and/or Exposed Employees
 Risk and exposure determinations are made without regard to employees™ protected characteristics
, as 
defined 
by local, state, and federal law
.    Any health
-related information and documentation gathered from employees is maintained 
confidentially and in compliance with state and federal law.
   a. Employees™ Self
-Monitoring
 The following employees should 
not
 report to work and, upon notification to 
WSU

work schedule:
  Employees who display COVID
-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore 
throat, new loss of smell or taste, and/or gastrointestinal problems, 
including nausea, diarrhea, 
and vomiting, whether or not accompanied by a formal COVID
-19 diagnosis; 
  Employees who
, in the last 14 days,
 have had 
close 
contact with 
and/or live with 
any perso
n having a confirmed COVID
-19 diagnosis; and 
  Employees who, in 
the last 14 days, have had close contact with and/or live with any person 
displaying COVID
-19 symptoms, 
such as 
fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, new loss 
of smell or taste, and/or gastrointestinal problems, including nausea, diarrhea, and vo
miting.

  Such employees may only resume in
-person work upon meeting all return
-to-work requirements, 
defined below. 
   b. Daily Screenings
 To prevent the spread of COVID
-19 and reduce the potential
 spread of the virus
, WSU 
screens 
employees on a daily basis
.   Employees are 
required to complete the WSU 
Campus Daily Screener
 each day, which includes the 
following questions:
 In the past 48 hours, or since your last visit to a University facility, have you experienced any of 
the following symptoms? (please check

ion?
  Have you had close contact in the last 14 days with an individual diagnosed with COVID
-19? 
*  Have you traveled via airplane internationally or domestically in the last 14 days? 
*  Have you had a COVID
-19 test and are currently awaiting results? 
*  If an employee answers
 yes 
to any of the above, 
access is denied, 
an automatic notification is sent to the 
Campus Health Center 
and
 the
 employee is 
screened and tested
 for infection
 in accord
ance with
 CDC 
guidelines. 
 Employees who develop symptoms during their shift 
must 
immediately report to their supervisor and
 contact the Campus Health Center
.   c.   
Return
-to-Work Requirements 
 Employees who were themselves diagnosed with COVID
-19 may only return to work upon 
confi
rmation of the cessation of symptoms and contagiousness
.  The parameters for approved return to 
work for employees 
are
 continuously evaluated and adjusted based upon guidance from the WSU Public 
Health Committee and in accordance with CDC guidelines
 with u
pdated information provided and 
implemented through the Campus Health Center.
 Employees may discontinue isolation and return to work upon achieving the following conditions:
